dekagen is a front-end to several tools for the ripping, converting, and
naming of MP3 and Ogg-Vorbis files. It automates the whole process of ripping
data from music compact discs (CD), the naming of the files, their converting
into MP3 or Ogg-Vorbis format and the labelling of the MP3 files with an ID3
tag. dekagen uses dialog for a user interface that is intended to be
"intuitive".

Music data is read from CDs using cdda2wav, cdparanoia, dagrab, or tosha, and
stored on your hard disk in wav-format. Note that this will have an excessive
need of disk space. After this, the wav-data is converted into MP3 format
using 8hz-mp3, bladeenc, l3enc, lame, mp3enc, or notlame, or into Ogg-Vorbis
format using oggenc. This will take a while. To avoid manual naming and
tagging for all the files, cda is used for CDDB lookups. To label the MP3
files with ID3 tags, id3ed, id3tag, id3tool, or mp3info, or the built-in
capabilities of some encoders (lame, notlame) are used. Ogg-Vorbis files can
be labelled with oggenc.
