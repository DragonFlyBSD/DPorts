This program reads /var/db/pkg/local.sqlite and compares install timestamp
with date in $FreeBSD header in the Makefile of the port. If there is no
$FreeBSD header then it is assumed to be a beta port.

Chucky also features a shar file backup feature, which is normally used to
backup 'beta' development ports.
