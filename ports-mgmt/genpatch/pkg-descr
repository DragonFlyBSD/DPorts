genpatch is a simple tool written in sh(1) for generating patches for use
in dports.  If only passed one path, it will automatically look for a
similar file with .intermediate or .orig extension and use them (in that
order) as the original file of which to be compared.

If the path is inside the WRKDIR, then genpatch assumes that the current
directory is $WRKSRC and will create a patch with the proper name rather
than sending the results to stdout.  These patches can be used directly
in the files or dragonfly directories of dports.

The "dupe" program quickly makes a properly named copy.
The "portfix" wrapper will run dupe, editor, and genpatch in sequence.

The editor is determined by PORTEDITOR or EDITOR environment variables,
and fails back to vi if neither are set.
