==================== U P G R A D E   W A R N I N G ====================

If you want to upgrade from a previous version of Sugar Community Edition,
you *must* upgrade using the Sugar Community Edition upgrade wizard instead
of upgrading your FreeBSD port using the ports/packages system.

If you upgrade your installation using either the 'portupgrade' command or
else by upgrading the port/package manually, your Sugar Community Edition
installation will become unusable, as Sugar Community Edition's database
upgrade procedures are contained only within the upgrade modules.

SugarCRM Inc. are aware of this issue and may address it in future
versions of their product.
