Grako (for grammar compiler) is a tool that takes grammars in a variation of
EBNF as input, and outputs memoizing (Packrat) PEG parsers in Python.

Grako can also compile a grammar stored in a string into a Grammar object that
can be used to parse any given input, much like the re module does with regular
expressions.
