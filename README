DragonFly Ports, a.k.a. "DPorts"
================================

DragonFly Ports is a derivative of FreeBSD's Ports Collection.  It serves
the same purpose for DragonFly as the Ports Collection does for FreeBSD,
which is to provide instructions on how to build software on DragonFly BSD.
The products of DPorts are executable software which are manipulated by
Baptiste Daroussin's pkgng binary package manager.

The traditional pkg_* tools seen previously on FreeBSD, DragonFly, and
currently with pkgsrc will not be offered.  They are antiquated and have
reached End-Of-Life on FreeBSD.

While anyone could clone this repository and build a DPort from source,
this will not be generally encouraged.  Unlike pkgsrc, the binary packages
will be built and made available continuously as opposed to quarterly sets.
Using pkgng to keep a system current will be recommended.

This repository is actually generated.  Starting with the Ports Collection
as a basis, DragonFly-specific patches and/or files are applied as necessary
to create a modified port that builds on DragonFly.  If the FreeBSD port is
updated in a way that either causes the patches to no longer apply, or just
plain fail to build on DragonFly, the update will not be carried forward.
The last working DPort will remain in place until a manual fix is provided
that allows the FreeBSD update to work on DragonFly as well.

Another project of Baptiste's, Poudriere, will be used to confirm good
builds.  Upon the event of successly build, a hook will update the patches
repository to indicate a good build, and then another script will generate
the DPort, place it here, and commit the change.  Theoretically, every
single DPort should build on DragonFly.

Please report generic issues (those that affect FreeBSD and DragonFly) at:
https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/

Please report DragonFly-specific issues here:
https://github.com/DragonFlyBSD/DPorts/issues/

If you are confident in a DragonFly-specific fix, please initiate a github
Pull Request here:
https://github.com/DragonFlyBSD/DeltaPorts

Note that since DPorts is generated, GitHub Pull Requests against DPorts
can not be accepted.  Only the DeltaPorts overlay or the FreeBSD ports
base can be modified.

This project was conceived and implemented by John Marino.
