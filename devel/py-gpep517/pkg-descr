gpep517 is a minimal tool to aid building wheels for Python packages
through PEP 517-compliant build systems and installing them. The
tool originated from Gentoo with its primary goals being absolutely
minimal dependency footprint to ease clean bootstrap without bundling
dependencies, and clean separation of functions to aid external
package managers. It is the tool of choice for a world that does
not revolve around pip and venvs.
