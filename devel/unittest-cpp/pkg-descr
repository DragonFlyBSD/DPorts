UnitTest++ is a lightweight unit testing framework for C++.
It was designed to do test-driven development on a wide variety of platforms.
Simplicity, portability, speed, and small footprint are all very important
aspects of UnitTest++. UnitTest++ is mostly standard C++ and makes minimal
use of advanced library and language features, which means it should be easily
portable to just about any platform.
