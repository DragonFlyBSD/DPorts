This package is a modified version of Doug Lea's malloc-2.8.3
implementation adapted for multiple threads, while trying to
avoid lock contention as much as possible.

As part of the GNU C library, the source files may be available under
the GNU Library General Public License (see the comments in the
files).  But as part of this stand-alone package, the code is also
available under the (probably less restrictive) conditions described
in the file 'COPYRIGHT'.  In any case, there is no warranty whatsoever
for this package.

This release was partly funded by Pixar Animation Studios.
