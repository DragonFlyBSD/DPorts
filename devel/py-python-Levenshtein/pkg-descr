The Levenshtein Python C extension module contains functions for fast
computation of:

* Levenshtein (edit) distance, and edit operations
* string similarity
* approximate median strings, and generally string averaging
* string sequence and set similarity

It supports both normal and Unicode strings.

Python 2.2 or newer is required; Python 3 is supported.
