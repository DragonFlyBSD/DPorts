Source Navigator NG is a source code analysis tool.
With it, you can edit your source code, display relationships
between classes and functions and members, and display call trees.

You can navigate your source code and easily get to declarations
or implementations of functions, variables and macros (commonly
called "symbols") which helps you discovering and mapping unknown
source code for enhancement or maintenance tasks.

It is based upon the old source navigator and strives to
improve usability and performance.
