Agar is a cross-platform GUI toolkit. Agar provides a base
framework and a collection of GUI widgets from which GUI
applications can be built.

Agar applications function seamlessly under X11 (with OpenGL),
Windows, MacOS X and SDL 1.2. Agar can also attach an existing
OpenGL or SDL context and operate as window manager for the
application. Agar is compact, efficient, and fully thread-safe.

Agar's functionality can be extended using simple C/C++ class
registration interfaces. Separate libraries which also extend
Agar's capabilities include FreeSG (http://FreeSG.org) and
Edacious (http://edacious.org).
