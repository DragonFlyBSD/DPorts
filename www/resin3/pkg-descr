Resin is a fast servlet and JSP engine supporting load balancing for increased
reliability. Resin encourages separation of content from style with its XSL
support. Servlets can generate simple XML and use an XSL filter to format
results for each client's capability, from palm pilots to Mozilla.  Resin
includes a full-featured HTTP/1.1 web server, provides a fast servlet runner
for Apache, and supports the latest Servlet 2.3 and JSP 1.2 specifications from
Sun.

Resin 3.0 Open Source is available under the GNU Public License (GPL).  It
contains all functional components of Resin, including EJB, but excludes
performance and clustering capabilities.
