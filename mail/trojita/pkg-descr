Trojita is a fast cross-platform Qt IMAP e-mail client.

Some highlights are:

* It is a pure Qt application with no additional dependencies
* Robust IMAP core implemented using Qt's Model-View framework
* Standards compliance, resources efficiency, interoperability and high
  productivity are primary design goals
* Integrates well into any reasonable desktop environment
* On-demand message list and body part loading
* Offline IMAP support
* Support for bandwidth-saving mode aimed at mobile users with expensive
  connection
* IMAP over SSH -- in addition to usual SSL/TLS connections, the server could
  be accessed via SSH
* Safe and robust dealing with HTML mail

Trojita is neither a full PIM suite nor a POP3 client.
