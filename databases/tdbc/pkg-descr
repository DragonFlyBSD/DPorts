TDBC is the Tcl Database Connectivity, an abstraction layer for database
drivers in the Tcl programming language. The interface is described in
TIP 308 (http://www.tcl.tk/cgi-bin/tct/tip/308) with updates in TIP 350
(http://www.tcl.tk/cgi-bin/tct/tip/350).

Currently, drivers for MySQL, ODBC, PostgreSQL, and SQLite3 are included.
