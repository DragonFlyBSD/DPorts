Gnocl implements a Tcl binding to the Gtk+ programming libraries for the rapid
development of graphical user interfaces. Designed to work with Tcl in a manner
consistent with the general syntax and command naming conventions of Tcl, Gnocl
provides a robust alternative to Tk for those developers which wish to develop
applications that seamlessly integrated into the Gnome desktop environment
without having to first familiarize themselves with the intricacies of the Gtk+
libraries and its dependencies.
