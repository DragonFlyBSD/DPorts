The KDE Telepathy project aims to integrate real time communication
deeply into KDE Workspaces, and to provide an infrastructure to aid
development of collaborative features for KDE Applications.

This module provides several plugins like auto-away, the infamous 'Now
listening to...' and also an error handler.
