CenterIM is a fork of CenterICQ.

CenterIM is a text mode menu- and window-driven IM interface that supports the
ICQ2000, Yahoo!, MSN, Gadu-Gadu and IRC protocols as well as posting to
LiveJournal aggregating RSS feeds.

It allows you to send, receive, and forward messages, URLs, SMSes, contacts,
and email express messages. It also lets you set your own and fetch others'
away messages, and define external handlers for incoming events. You can mass
message-send, search for users, view users' details, maintain your contact
list directly from the program, view the message history, register a new UIN
and update your details, be informed upon receipt of email messages,
automatically set away after the defined period of inactivity, and have your
own ignore, visible, and invisible lists.  It can also associate events with
sounds, make log of events, and allows arrangement of contacts into groups.

The development of CenterIM is currently quite active, but is still happy
to find more users helping with contributing bug reports, suggestions,
feedback and code.

mailing lists on the CenterIM homepage or on #centerim at the Freenode IRC.
