A thousand years into post-apocalyptic Earth, many forms of life
have gone extinct, including humans. An alien robot series, called
Minilens, is cleaning up the Earth and collecting the surviving
flora for research purposes.

The robots' duty is to destroy all radioactive barrels and to collect
all flora.

Aliens forgot that Earth has gravity, therefore Minilens can't jump.
