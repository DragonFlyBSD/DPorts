glBSP is a node builder specially designed to be used with OpenGL
ports of the DOOM game engine. It adheres to the "GL-Friendly Nodes"
specification, which means it adds some new special nodes to a WAD
file that makes it very easy (and fast !) for an OpenGL DOOM engine to
compute the polygons needed for drawing the levels.
There are many DOOM ports that understand the GL Nodes which glBSP
creates, including: EDGE, the Doomsday engine (JDOOM), Doom3D, PrBoom,
and Vavoom.
