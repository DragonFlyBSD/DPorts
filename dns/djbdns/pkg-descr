DJBDNS is a collection of Domain Name System tools. It includes
several components:

  * The dnscache program is a local DNS cache. It accepts recursive DNS
    queries from local clients such as web browsers. It collects
    responses from remote DNS servers.
  * The tinydns program is a fast, UDP-only DNS server. It makes local
    DNS information available to the Internet.
  * The pickdns program is a load-balancing DNS server. It points
    clients to a dynamic selection of IP addresses.
  * The walldns program is a reverse DNS wall. It provides matching
    reverse and forward records while hiding local host information.
  * The dns library handles outgoing and incoming DNS packets. It can be
    used by clients such as web browsers to look up host addresses, host
    names, MX records, etc. It supports asynchronous resolution.
  * The dnsfilter program is a parallel IP-address-to-host-name
    converter.
  * The dnsip, dnsipq, dnsname, dnstxt, and dnsmx programs are simple
    command-line interfaces to DNS.
  * The dnsq and dnstrace programs are DNS debugging tools.
