MyDNS is a free DNS server for UNIX implemented from scratch and
designed to utilize the MySQL database for data storage.

Its primary objectives are stability, security, interoperability,
and speed, though not necessarily in that order.

MyDNS does not include recursive name service, nor a resolver library.
It is primarily designed for organizations with many zones and/or
resource records who desire the ability to perform real-time dynamic
updates on their DNS data via MySQL.
