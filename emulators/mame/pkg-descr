MAME stands for Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator. When used in
conjunction with images of the original arcade game's ROM and disk
data, MAME attempts to reproduce that game as faithfully as possible
on a more modern general-purpose computer. MAME can currently emulate
several thousand different classic arcade video games from the late
1970s through the modern era.
