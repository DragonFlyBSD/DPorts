This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when upgrading
your ports.  We try our best to minimize these disruptions, but sometimes
they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each time
you update your ports collection, before attempting any port upgrades.

20221012:
  AFFECTS: devel/websvn
  AUTHOR: michael.osipov@siemens.com

  WebSVN 2.8.0 includes full PHP 8.x support which requires a change from PEAR
  to Composer 2. You must manually install dependencies through it, the ports
  system will not handle it anymore for you since */horde* (PR 266552) has been
  marked as incompatible with PHP 8.x for the time being. See pkg-message for
  detailed instructions.

20220929:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/bmeps
  AUTHOR: takefu@airport.fm

  The executable name has been changed from this edition from bmpp to bitmap2pp

20220925:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to the latest stable version 3.5 of LibreSSL.
  The shared library versions of the libraries have been bumped.

  After upgrading, manually update all packages that depend on any of the
  libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and libtls) since the
  versions of these libraries have changed. Normally, you can obtain the
  list of dependent software by running the following command:

  # pkg info -r libressl

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies.

20220919:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/schilyutils
  AUTHOR: fuz@fuz.su

  Schilyutils has been split up into two ports. If you want the bosh shell,
  the new port is shells/bosh, which can be installed with:

  # pkg install bosh
    or
  # portmaster -o shells/bosh

20220918:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/roundcube
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  Roundcube has been upgraded to 1.6.0 and introduces breaking changes to
  configuration options of remote services (imap, smtp, ldap, sieve). Check
  https://roundcube.net/news/2022/07/28/roundcube-1.6.0-released for details.

  Version 1.6 no longer includes the Classic and Larry skins, which are now
  available as separate mail/roundcube-classic and mail/roundcube-larry ports.

20220910:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/cmake
  AUTHOR: diizzy@FreeBSD.org

  CMake has been converted to a meta-port and new CMake packages created causes
  conflicts with old binary packages prior to this change.

  If CMake was installed using binary packages via pkg it needs to be
  uninstalled using pkg delete before installing CMake and related packages
  after this change.

    pkg delete cmake
    pkg install cmake-core

  If you're using portmaster you also need to delete the old CMake package
  before upgrading.

20220909:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/qemu
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  emulators/qemu has been updated to 7.1.0. Previous 7.0.X branch has
  been repocopied to emulators/qemu70. If someone wants to stick with 7.0.X
  branch please use one of the following command:

  # pkg install qemu70/qemu70-nox11(based on flavor used)
    or
  # portmaster -o emulators/qemu70 emulators/qemu
    or
  # portupgrade -o emulators/qemu70 emulators/qemu

20220903:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/vim
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  The Vim port no longer installs a system-wide vimrc. It drastically affected
  config loading order, and led to various settings being clobbered, duplicated,
  or ignored.

  Vim's provided defaults.vim (/usr/local/share/vim/vim90/defaults.vim) continues
  to be read just as before, but its settings are no longer clobbered. Take a look
  in there for any settings you may want to change, and do ':h initialization' to
  see where Vim looks for config files.

20220903:
  AFFECTS: users of archivers/py-borgbackup
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  Borgbackup has been upgraded to version 1.2.  For users who you wish to
  continue using version 1.1, use either of these commands for upgrading:

  With binary packages through pkg:
    pkg set -o archivers/py-borgbackup:archivers/py-borgbackup11
    pkg upgrade
  With portmaster or portupgrade (replace the command accordingly):
    portmaster -o archivers/py-borgbackup11 archivers/py-borgbackup

20220901:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/rainloop-community
  AUTHOR: yasu@FreeBSD.org

  Since 1.17.0 upstream distributes only one edition "lagacy" under MIT license
  and mail/rainloop-community is remove as a result. So please uninstall
  mail/rainloop-community (rainloop-community-phpXY) and install mail/rainloop
  (rainloop-phpXY) instead.

20220831:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/xscreensaver on 13.1-RELEASE
  AUTHOR: zirias@FreeBSD.org

  With the update to 6.04, xscreensaver now uses security/unix-selfauth-helper
  for PAM authentication. This relies on pam_exec.so, which had a bug causing
  a segfault on authentication attempts prior to 13.1-RELEASE-p1. For details,
  please see
  https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-EN-22:19.pam_exec.asc

  Make sure your system is fully upgraded, otherwise you might be unable to
  unlock your screen.

20220825:
  AFFECTS: users of net/xrdp or net/xrdp-devel
  AUTHOR: meta@FreeBSD.org

  After xorg upgrade to 21.1.4, xorgxrdp session doesn't start as before
  This is because bin/Xorg has been replaced with X server binary wrapper.
  You must manually edit the Xorg section in etc/xrdp/sesman.ini to get it
  working again.

  The following is a short example of where, how to modify sesman.ini.
  Make sure to replace LOCALBASE with your actual path.

   [Xorg]
   ; Specify the path of non-suid Xorg executable. It might differ depending
   ; on your distribution and version. Find out the appropreate path for your
   ; environment. The typical path is known as follows:
   ;
   ; Fedora 26 or later    :  param=/usr/libexec/Xorg
   ; Debian 9 or later     :  param=/usr/lib/xorg/Xorg
   ; Ubuntu 16.04 or later :  param=/usr/lib/xorg/Xorg
   ; Arch Linux            :  param=/usr/lib/Xorg
   ; CentOS 7              :  param=/usr/bin/Xorg or param=Xorg
   ; CentOS 8              :  param=/usr/libexec/Xorg
   ;
  -param=Xorg
  +param=LOCALBASE/libexec/Xorg

20220815:
  AFFECTS: users of net/keycloak
  AUTHOR: fernape@FreeBSD.org

  The flavors -mysql and -postgres were removed, the necessary configuration
  for those database backends was rolled into the base release by upstream.
  The configuration files changed completely, so they need to be rebuilt from
  scratch.

20220807:
  AFFECTS: users of news/inn
  AUTHOR: kbowling@FreeBSD.org

  The inn port has been updated to 2.7 release.  Users upgrading from
  prior versions should read through the announcement for any manual
  upgrading steps that apply to your environment.

  https://lists.isc.org/pipermail/inn-announce/2022-July/000015.html

20220711:
  AFFECTS: users of security/stunnel
  AUTHOR: zi@FreeBSD.org

  The stunnel port has been updated to drop privileges to the stunnel
  user by default.

  As a result of this change, the pid file location has changed.  If
  you have a running copy of stunnel, you should stop the process
  before performing the upgrade.  Alternatively, you will need to
  # pkill stunnel;service stunnel start
  after the upgrade has been completed.

202207XYZ:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/maven-wrapper and devel/maven
  AUTHOR: michaelo@apache.org

  The environment variable M2_HOME has been replaced with more common
  MAVEN_HOME which can be used to pass a custom Maven home directory.

20220629:
  AFFECTS: updating x11-servers/xorg-server from a port
  AUTHOR: se@FreeBSD.org

  The xorg-server port now has a library dependency on x11/libxcvt,
  which cannot be installed when the previous version of xorg-server
  is present.  To be able to update xorg-server from a port, the
  previous version needs to be manually deinstalled to allow libxcvt
  to be installed.

20220628:
  AFFECTS: users of Erlang and Elixir
  AUTHOR: dch@FreeBSD.org

  For more than a decade, the Elixir Mix tool and the Erlang rebar
  or erlang.mk build tools have been the defacto way of installing
  and managing packages for specific applications.

  All main-stream applications, from Riak, CouchDB, RabbitMQ, Phoenix,
  and Elixir, expect that packages are fetched and compiled into an OTP
  Release, with in-built version locking, external package management.

  There is no point in maintaining a large number of libraries, that
  are used neither for development, nor operations.

  Users are directed to https://rebar3.org/ https://erlang.mk/ or
  https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html
  to fetch custom packages.

  https://www.freebsd.org/status/report-2021-07-2021-09/#_freebsd_erlang_ecosystem_ports_update

20220626:
  AFFECTS: users of python
  AUTHOR: thierry@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of python3 and python was switched to 3.9.

  For ports users wanting to keep version 3.8 as default,
  add DEFAULT_VERSIONS+= python=3.8 python3=3.8 to make.conf

  Following procedures may ease the upgrade:

  For users of pre-build packages:
  # sh
  # for i in $(pkg query -g %n 'py38-*'); do pkg set -yn ${i}:py39-${i#py38-}; done
  # pkg upgrade

  For portmaster users:
  # sh
  # portmaster -o lang/python39 python38
  # REINSTALL="$(pkg info -o "*py38*" | awk '{printf "%s ", $2}')"
  # pkg delete -f "*py38*"
  # portmaster $REINSTALL
  # REBUILD=$(pkg query -g "%n:%dn" '*' | grep py3 | grep -v py39 | cut -d : -f 1 | sort -u)
  # portmaster $REBUILD
  # REBUILD2=$(pkg list | grep python-38 | xargs pkg which | awk '{print $6}' | sort -u)
  # portmaster $REBUILD2

  Final steps (for pre-built packages & portmaster):

  If no longer required, Python 3.8 can be removed via
  "pkg remove python38" and the directory /usr/local/lib/python3.8 can
  then be deleted afterwards, if not empty.

20220625:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/fusefs-bindfs
  AUTHOR: doralitze@chaotikum.org

  Bindfs defaults to use direct I/O since version 1.16. While this results
  in major performance improvements as well as several bug fixes, this also
  breaks direct legacy calls to mmap. If your application still uses them
  consider these two options:

  1. Mount using `--no-direct-io`
  2. Upgrade your application in order to query mapping guards

20220623:
  AFFECTS: users of science/gramps
  AUTHOR: fernape@FreeBSD.org

  databases/py-bsddb3 is deprecated and will be removed in the future. With that
  gramps will lose the ability to load family trees using Berkeley DB.
  It is suggested to migrate all family trees using Berkeley DB by exporting
  them to gramps xml and import that gramps xml into a family tree using sqlite
  as database.

20220620:
  AFFECTS: users of www/selenium
  AUTHOR: fernape@FreeBSD.org

  The port has changed startup args so if you are using selenium_args= in
  rc.conf you need to add the parameter "standalone" manually.

20220616:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netbox
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  /!\ WARNING /!\

  The NetBox 3.2 release contains major changes, so at least items 1.), 2.)
  and 3.) must be checked before proceeding with the upgrade!

  /!\ WARNING /!\

  1. This release includes a database migration that will remove the "asn",
     "contact_name", "contact_phone", and "contact_email" fields from the
     site model.  (These fields have been superseded by the ASN and contact
     models introduced in NetBox v3.1.)

     To protect against the accidental destruction of data, the upgrade
     process will fail if any sites still have data in any of these fields.

     To bypass this safeguard, set the NETBOX_DELETE_LEGACY_DATA environment
     variable when running the upgrade script, which will permit the
     destruction of legacy data.

     A set of migration scripts is available to assist with the migration of
     legacy site data:

     https://github.com/netbox-community/migration-scripts

  2. NetBox v3.2 requires Python 3.8 or later.

  3. If the NetBox Plugin "net-mgmt/py-netbox-plugin-extension" is used,
     please disable it before the migrations are applied.  This can be done
     by removing the entry "netbox_plugin_extensions" from the "PLUGINS"
     section in the NetBox configuration.

     Once the upgrade is done, this port/package can be safely removed as
     it's no longer required.

  4. Please also check the pkg-message and the changelogs for further info.

20220608:
  AFFECTS: devel/autoconf-wrapper, devel/autoconf213
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  These ports have been renamed to devel/autoconf-switch and devel/autoconf2.13
  respectively.  If your favourite port updating tool cannot handle that then
  just remove the packages with "pkg delete" and then install the new port.

20220607:
  AFFECTS: security/openssh-portable
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  OpenSSH has been updated to 9.0p1 with incompatible changes.
  See https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-9.0 for details.

20220602:
  AFFECTS: sysutils/graylog
  AUTHOR: dch@FreeBSD.org

  Graylog 4.3.0+ fails to start if graylog's internal collector for
  system statistics is enabled. This will eventually be addressed
  upstream.

  Add disable_native_system_stats_collector=true to your graylog.conf.

20220513:
  AFFECTS: devel/nexus2-oss
  AUTHOR: michael.osipov@siemens.com

  Nexus 2.15.x introduces incompatible configuration changes. You
  must review changes in ETCDIR/wrapper.conf and ETCDIR/jetty*.xml
  with updated samples as well as NEXUS_WORKDIR/conf/logback-nexus.xml
  with its origin from
  DATADIR/nexus/WEB-INF/lib/nexus-core-VERSION.jar!/META-INF/log/logback-nexus.xml,
  grant write access to files in ETCDIR since Nexus itself might
  update files in place otherwise your instance will not properly
  work after the update.

20220510
  AFFECTS: sysutils/zrepl
  AUTHOR: monwarez@gmail.com

  The zrepl update to 0.5.0.8 includes the following breaking changes:
  - The Prometheus metric zrepl_version_daemon was converted to zrepl_start_time
  The metric still reports the zrepl version in a label.
  But the metric *value* is now the Unix timestamp at the time the daemon was started.
  The Grafana dashboard in zrepl examples directory has been updated.

20220502:
  AFFECTS: mail/mutt
  AUTHOR: dereks@lifeofadishwasher.com

  Default header cache option has been changed to the new option LMDB using
  databases/lmdb. The BDB option still exists but now uses databases/db18 due
  to the EOL of databases/db5.

20220501:
  AFFECTS: users of drm-current-kmod and drm-devel-kmod
  AUTHOR: manu@FreeBSD.org

  Both ports where removed.
  If you were using either one of them directly (i.e. without using
  graphics/drm-kmod metaport) use graphics/drm-510-kmod.
  If you have some problems with this one try drm-54-kmod and report
  a bug on https://github.com/freebsd/drm-kmod.

20220428:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/redis
  AUTHOR: yasu@FreeBSD.org

  The databases/redis port has been updated to 7.0. Users wanting to
  stay on 6.2 can replace databases/redis with databases/redis62 with
  one of the following commands.

  If you use pkg with binary packages:
    # pkg set -o databases/redis:databases/redis62
    # pkg upgrade
  If you use portmaster:
    # portmaster -o databases/redis62 databases/redis
  If you use portupgrade:
    # portupgrade -o databases/redis62 databases/redis

20220426:
  AFFECTS: users of deskutils/grantleetheme
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  The pkg update of deskutils/grantleetheme to 22.04 can fail due
  to a filesystem location having changed from being a file to being
  a directory. This leads to pkg's temporary file creation throwing
  an error.

  To update to KDE Gear 22.04 please run
  # pkg delete -f grantleetheme
  prior to the update.

20220424:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/qemu
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  emulators/qemu has been updated to 7.0.0. Previous 6.2.X branch has
  been repocopied to emulators/qemu6. If someone wants to stick with 6.2.X
  branch please use one of the following command:

  # pkg install qemu6/qemu6-nox11(based on flavor used)
    or
  # portmaster -o emulators/qemu6 emulators/qemu
    or
  # portupgrade -o emulators/qemu6 emulators/qemu

20220421:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby27
  AUTHOR: yasu@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 2.7 to 3.0.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 2.7 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 2.7 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ruby=2.7

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  software that uses ruby. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  upon how you manage your system.

  If you use pkg, simply upgrade:
  # pkg upgrade

  If you do not use pkg, please check entry 20190420.
  The description there should also work for this version.

20220413:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/py-matrix-synapse
  AUTHOR: ports@skyforge.at

  Synapse will now refuse to start up if open registration is enabled,
  in order to help mitigate abuse across the federation. If you would
  like to provide registration to anyone, consider adding email,
  recaptcha or token-based verification in order to prevent automated
  registration from bad actors. This check can be disabled by setting
  the enable_registration_without_verification option in your
  homeserver configuration file to true. More details are available in
  the upgrade notes[0].

  Synapse will additionally now refuse to start when using PostgreSQL
  with a non-C values for COLLATE and CTYPE, unless the config flag
  allow_unsafe_locale, found in the database section of the
  configuration file, is set to true. See the upgrade notes[1] for
  details.

20220410:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/screen
  AUTHOR: cy@FreeBSD.org

  As of sysutils/screen-4.9.0_5, the MULTUSER option is default, reverting
  to the traditional setuid-root behavior. People who wish to secure their
  screen install must terminate all screen sessions, then install screen
  without the MULTIUSER option. The option was reversed because it caused
  too much astonishment among users of screen.

20220401:
  AFFECTS: security/sshguard
  AUTHOR: kevinz5000@gmail.com

  Blacklisting is now disabled by default to avoid overriding the setting in
  sshguard.conf. To enable blacklisting, uncomment the BLACKLIST_FILE line in
  sshguard.conf.

20220329:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/screen
  AUTHOR: cy@FreeBSD.org

  As of sysutils/screen-4.9.0_3, the multiuser feature is not supported
  by default. The multiuser feature requires setuid root to function.
  This creates a security risk. Some Linux distributions have had
  non-setuuid root screen for a dozen or more years. FreeBSD is following
  suit. A new MULTIUSER option has been added to enable users to install
  setuid root screen. The MULTIUSER option default is OFF.

  Users who wish to use the multiuser feature may,

  - Build screen using the MULTIUSER option, or
  - Poudriere users can use poudriere-options to enable the MULTIUSER
    option, or
  - Users can chmod the setuid bit for ${LOCALBASE}/bin/screen-4.9.0,
    making screen setuid root to enable the multiuser feature.

20220326:
  AFFECTS: users of misc/freebsd-doc-*
  AUTHOR: blackend@FreeBSD.org

  A change to the doc toolchain prevents the build of individual
  localized HTML versions of the documentation without building the
  en_US version.  HTML option is currently disabled until a good
  solution is found.  PDF version, the default option, is now the only
  available option.

  Please re-run "make config" to pick up this new default.

20220313:
  AFFECTS: users of net/unison
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  unison has been updated to version 2.52. The new version introduces
  a new wire protocol and on disk archive format. This new version
  is compatible with 2.51 clients for communication, so it's now
  possible to upgrade one side and then the other.

  The archive files are automatically converted to the new version,
  but once they are converted the y are incompatible with the
  previous version.

  In case you need version 2.51, the previous version of the port
  is preserved in net/unison251.

20220311:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/get_iplayer
  AUTHOR: jamie@catflap.org

  get_iplayer has a number of changes to quality settings that may
  break existing configurations. Please see the release notes for
  further information:

  https://github.com/get-iplayer/get_iplayer/wiki/release320to329#release329

20220311:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/virtualbox-ose
  AUTHOR: grembo@FreeBSD.org

  In order to comply to hier(7), VirtualBox's configuration of non-default
  IP ranges to be used in host-only mode moved from /etc/vbox/networks.conf
  to ${LOCALBASE}/etc/vbox/networks.conf.

20220311:
  AFFECTS: users of net/nats-server
  AUTHOR: olgeni@FreeBSD.org

  A dedicated 'nats' user was added, replacing 'nobody' in the startup script.
  You should check your configuration and assign updated ownership to your data
  files.

20220227:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/bmeps
  AUTHOR: takefu@airport.fm

  The binary and man page have been renamed from bmpp{.1.gz} to bitmap2pp{.1.gz}

20220225:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-toolkits/py-wxPython40
  AUTHOR: lbartoletti@FreeBSD.org

  x11-toolkits/py-wxPython40 has been removed to be replaced by the 4.1
  version.
  However the new wxPython ports is now named x11-toolkits/py-wxPython4.

  Depending on the tools you use, you may have to remove the port
  before ports upgrade.

20220224:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/openfire
  AUTHOR: nikita@druba.su

  The port version have been updated from 4.6.x to 4.7.x.
  It is recommended to do database and configs backup before updating.

20220219:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/intel-pcm-devel
  AUTHOR: egypcio@FreeBSD.org

  sysutils/intel-pcm-devel became quite obsolete once sysutils/intel-pcm is
  now pretty much following a constant and stable update cycle, so users of
  the -devel version are encouraged to switch to it.

  If you still have sysutils/intel-pcm-devel installed, please delete it from
  your system and install sysutils/intel-pcm instead:

  # pkg delete sysutils/intel-pcm-devel
  # pkg install sysutils/intel-pcm

20220219:
  AFFECTS: users of math/qhull*
  AUTHOR: stephen@FreeBSD.org

  Because of entries in MOVED, portupgrade can get confused updating qhull.
  It is recommended that you delete qhull and ports depending upon it, and
  then reinstalling all the dependent ports.

20220218:
  AFFECTS: users of TeX*
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  TeX system has been updated to 2021 from 2015. Normal pkg upgrade or
  portmaster -a should handle all the upgrade properly. In case not please
  create a ticket or send a mail to tex@FreeBSD.org

  print/tex-aleph has been removed as per upstream. This package should be
  removed manually. Additionally users have reported to delete
  texlive-texmf prior to starting update, or pkg-static will indicate
  there is a conflict during the upgrade of texlive-base :

  # pkg remove tex-aleph texlive-texmf

20220218:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/librenms
  AUTHOR: dvl@FreeBSD.org

  The storage directory has moved from WWWDIR to /var/db/librenms/storage
  to comply with man 7 hier. When upgrading, you may need to manually create
  this symlink.

20220212:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/php8[01][-extensions]?
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  Non-Default OPTION MYSQL80 has been removed in lieu of making
  php8[01]-openssl as part of DEFAULT php8[01] installation. Although
  for php74 it is not the case. Ports that depends on
  security/php8[01]-openssl will no longer be installed as these have
  been removed. There is no side effect of this for ports which have
  USE_PHP=openssl. In case for php74 as the default php74-openssl will
  be installed otherwise it will be used from php installation.

  If you are using pkg, you have to remove php8[01]-openssl manually after
  the upgrade :

  # pkg info \*php8\* > ~/installed-php-ports-list

  # pkg upgrade -y
  # pkg delete -f php8[01]-openssl
  # service -R

  While rebuilding from ports users old php.conf is not overwritten. So
  have to manually remove the ports. For portmaster users:
  # sh
  # REINSTALL="$(pkg info -o "*php80*" | grep -v openssl | awk '{printf "%s ", $2}')"
  # pkg delete -f "*php80*"
  # portmaster $REINSTALL
  # portmaster -a

20220207:
  AFFECTS: users of security/amavisd-new
  AUTHOR: flo@FreeBSD.org

  Amavis does now depend on archivers/7-zip (7zz) you might need to update
  your amavisd.conf and replace all ocurances of p7zip (7zr) accordingly.

  AFFECTS: users of editors/neovim
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  Neovim now uses luajit-openresty as the Lua provider. Many neovim plugins
  compile some of their code (Packer does this, as do many LSP plugins).
  Neovim will produce errors and fail to load the plugins.

  Deleting and reinstalling any plugins that produce errors should fix the
  startup.

  If you use Packer, you also want to delete the startup cache:

  # rm -rf ~/.config/nvim/plugin/packer_compiled.lua

  AFFECTS: users of x11-fonts/source-sans-ttf
  AUTHOR: fernape@FreeBSD.org

  The font name has changed its prefix from SourceSansPro* to SourceSans*.
  Users of this font might need to change their configurations to pick up
  the new names.

  AFFECTS: users of net-im/dendrite
  AUTHOR: ashish@FreeBSD.org

  The configuration needs to be updated to version 2 following upgrade to
  Dendrite v0.6. Please refer to /usr/local/etc/dendrite/dendrite.yaml.sample
  for a sample configuration.

  AFFECTS: users of PyQt
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  Most of the PyQt ports have been merged into single port devel/py-qt5-pyqt.
  `pkg upgrade` will handle update automatically .

  AFFECTS: users of mail/bogofilter, mail/bogofilter-lmdb
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of mail/bogofilter now uses LMDB instead
  of Berkeley DB. It is not compatible and cannot read databases.

  Your options are:
  1. use bogoutil on each wordlist for each of your users first,
  ONLY THEN reinstall bogofilter, THEN reload the databases with bogoutil,
  OR
  2. install the matching bogofilter version and
  If you had been using bogofilter-lmdb so far, install bogofilter.
  If you had been using bogofilter so far, install bogofilter-bdb.

20220125:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/php74
  AUTHOR: tz@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of PHP has been switched from 7.4 to 8.0.

  If you use binary packages you should make a list of php packages
  before running 'pkg upgrade':

  # pkg info \*php7\* > ~/installed-php-ports-list

  After the upgrade, check with such list if all your php extensions
  are still installed, and reinstall them if needed.

  If you use mod_php74 you need to deinstall it and install mod_php80.

20220120:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-wm/dwm
  AUTHOR: 0mp@FreeBSD.org

  dwm has been updated to 6.3. The option RUGAPS is no longer available because
  it depends on a patch only available for version 6.2. RUGAPS can be
  reintroduced if desired once it is ported to 6.3 by the interested party.

  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netbox
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  1. Please make sure that the PostgreSQL server for the NetBox instance is
     running version 10 or higher.  This is because PostgreSQL 9.6 is
     End-of-Life since November 2021 and NetBox 3.1 makes use of the
     "macaddr8" field which was introduced with PostgreSQL 10.

  2. Please also check the pkg-message and the changelogs for further info.
