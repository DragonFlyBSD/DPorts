This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when upgrading
your ports.  We try our best to minimize these disruptions, but sometimes
they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each time
you update your ports collection, before attempting any port upgrades.

20240620:
  AFFECTS: net-mgmt/net-snmp
  AUTHOR: markj@FreeBSD.org

  The snmpd and snmptrapd daemons now drop privileges by default when started
  using the rc scripts provided in the package.  Make sure that snmpd
  configuration in /usr/local/share/snmp is readable by the "snmpd" user.  If
  you have defined extension scripts in snmpd.conf, make sure that they can be
  executed by an unprivileged user.  To revert to the old behavior of always
  running as root, set snmpd_sugid="NO" or snmptrapd_sugid="NO" in /etc/rc.conf.

  See the snmpd rc script for a hint on how to debug any permission problems
  that might arise as a result of this change.

20240615:
  AFFECTS: mail/cyrus-imapd25
  AUTHOR: ume@FreeBSD.org

  The BDB option is disabled by default.

  If you are using the berkeley cyrusdb backend, we strongly recommend
  that you switch to something other than the berkeley cyrusdb
  backend.  If you want to continue using the berkeley cyrusdb
  backend, build the cyrus-imapd25 port yourself with the BDB option
  enabled.

20240613:
  AFFECTS: multimedia/audacios and multimedia/audacious-plugins
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Upstream project made qt6 the new default, so the port flavors have
  been updated to follow this change.

  If you are using the qt6 flavor, you should uninstall it and install
  the unflavored package. If you want to keep using the qt5 version it
  will be updated automatically to the qt6 version. If you should
  uninstall the unflavored package and instal the qt5 version.

20240606:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/unifi8
  AUTHOR: ronald@FreeBSD.org

  The default MongoDB version dependency has been switched from 5.0 to 6.0.
  Although MongoDB 5.0 -> MongoDB 6.0 datafiles in-place upgrade seem to
  work, users are strongly recommended to take full backup of unifi
  database prior to upgrade and start with clean installation afterwards.

  For an in-place upgrade it is important that the MongoDB
  'featureCompatibilityVersion' is set to 5.0.
  See: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v6.0/release-notes/6.0-upgrade-standalone/#feature-compatibility-version
  Run these commands in mongodb50 before upgrading (e.g. while unifi is running):
  $ mongo --port 27117
  > db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "5.0" } )
  > exit

  See updating entry 20230310 for a backup/restore upgrade.

20240604:
  AFFECTS: net-mgmt/net-snmp
  AUTHOR: markj@FreeBSD.org

  The net-snmp port's newsyslog(8) configuration has been updated such
  that the snmpd log file will be owned by the snmpd user following log
  rotation.  This is done to make it easier to run snmpd as the snmpd
  user rather than as root, using the snmpd_sugid rc.conf option.
  For now snmpd still runs as root by default.  This is expected to change
  in the future.

20240529:
  AFFECTS: users of TeX*
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  TeX system has been updated to 2024 from 2023. Normal pkg upgrade or
  portmaster -a should handle all the upgrade properly. In case not please
  create a ticket or send a mail to tex@FreeBSD.org

  Previously users have reported to delete texlive-texmf prior to
  starting update, or pkg-static will indicate there is a conflict
  during the upgrade of texlive-base :

  # pkg remove texlive-texmf

20240529:
  AFFECTS: users of python
  AUTHOR: rm@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of python3 and python was switched to 3.11.

  For ports users wanting to keep version 3.9 as default,
  add DEFAULT_VERSIONS+= python=3.9 python3=3.9 to make.conf

  Following procedures may ease the upgrade:

  For users of pre-build packages:
  # sh
  # for i in $(pkg query -g %n 'py39-*'); do pkg set -yn ${i}:py311-${i#py39-}; done
  # pkg upgrade

  For portmaster users:
  # sh
  # portmaster -o lang/python311 python39
  # REINSTALL="$(pkg info -oq '*py39*')"
  # pkg delete -f "*py39*"
  # portmaster $REINSTALL
  # REBUILD=$(pkg query -g "%n:%dn" '*' | grep py3 | grep -v py311 | cut -d : -f 1 | sort -u)
  # portmaster $REBUILD
  # REBUILD2=$(pkg list | grep python-39 | xargs pkg which | awk '{print $6}' | sort -u)
  # portmaster $REBUILD2

  Final steps (for pre-built packages & portmaster):

  If no longer required, Python 3.9 can be removed via
  "pkg remove python39" and the directory /usr/local/lib/python3.9 can
  then be deleted afterwards, if not empty.

20240522:
  AFFECTS: net-p2p/transmission-daemon

  The web interface has been separated from the daemon port into its own port.
  This allows users of transmission-gtk and transmission-qt to install the web
  interface.

20240521:
  AFFECTS: www/gitlab
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  Make sure you upgrade first to 16.11.x before you upgrade to the today
  released version 17.0.0.

  For more details see:
  https://gitlab.fechner.net/mfechner/Gitlab-docu/-/blob/master/update/16.11-17.0-freebsd.md

20240517:
  AFFECTS: comms/tio
  AUTHOR: diizzy@FreeBSD.org

  As of 3.1 upstream have reworked configuration file layout and syntax
  so older configurations will not work.

  For more details, see

  https://github.com/tio/tio/releases/tag/v3.1

20240513:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to the latest stable version 3.9 of LibreSSL.
  The shared library versions of the libraries have been bumped.

  After upgrading, manually update all packages that depend on any of the
  libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and libtls) since the
  versions of these libraries have changed. Normally, you can obtain the
  list of dependent software by running the following command:

  # pkg info -r libressl

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies.

20240509:
  AFFECTS: databases/timescaledb
  AUTHOR: kbowling@FreeBSD.org

  The Foreign Key storage in hypertables has changed in an incompatible way,
  after runing ALTER EXTENSION, you must run the SQL script here:
  https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb-extras/blob/master/utils/2.15.X-fix_hypertable_foreign_keys.sql

  For more details, see

  https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb/pull/6797

20240508:
  AFFECTS: www/oauth2-proxy
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  The start script is converted to be instance aware.  To use it:
   - cp /usr/local/etc/oauth2-proxy.cfg.sample /usr/local/etc/oauth2-proxy-myapp.cfg
   - vi /usr/local/etc/oauth2-proxy-myapp.cfg
   - ln -s oauth2_proxy /usr/local/etc/rc.d/oauth2_proxy_myapp
   - sysctl oauth2_proxy_myapp_enable=YES
   - service oauth2_proxy_myapp start
  This allows to easily start multiple instances on the same system.

  As part of this, the start script was renamed to oauth2_proxy. This only
  affects manual restarts, no change in rc.conf is needed.

20240430:
  AFFECTS: audio/py-pyradio
  AUTHOR: nivit@FreeBSD.org

  The new version of Pyradio moves some data files to new locations.
  To see what it really does, run pyradio from a terminal the first time.
  Besides that, the recordings are moved/saved into ~/pyradio-recordings.
  You can change that directory in the config file.

  For more details, see

  https://github.com/coderholic/pyradio/releases/tag/0.9.3

20240423:
  AFFECTS: textproc/vale
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  When upgrading to v3.0.0, the vocabularies need to be moved from
  $StylesPath/Vocab to $StylesPath/config/vocabularies.

20240421:
  AFFECTS: www/gitlab-ce
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  With the upgrade to version 16.11 the default path for gitlab-ce changed:
  /usr/local/www/gitlab-ce -> /usr/local/www/gitlab
  Make sure you follow the upgrade manual very carefully:
  https://gitlab.fechner.net/mfechner/Gitlab-docu/-/blob/master/update/16.10-16.11-freebsd.md

  The gitlab port also got a new flavor gitlab@ee to make the Gitlab
  Enterprise Edition available (you will need a license for it).
  Please note, that the ee flavor is a draft, but any feedback is welcome.
  See also the installation and upgrade manual for more details.
  https://gitlab.fechner.net/mfechner/Gitlab-docu/-/blob/master/install/16.11-freebsd.md

20240408:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/p5-DBD-mysql
  AUTHOR: flo@FreeBSD.org

  Upstream removed support for MariaDB from the 5.0 branch. So if you use
  MariaDB you need to use databases/p5-DBD-mysql4 from now on.

  Portmaster users:
        portmaster -o databases/p5-DBD-mysql4 databases/p5-DBD-mysql
        portmaster -a

  Portupgrade users:
        portupgrade -o databases/p5-DBD-mysql4 -f databases/p5-DBD-mysql
        portupgrade -a

20240330:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/spamassassin
  AUTHOR: cy@FreeBSD.org

  sa-update must be run following update and prior to restarting sa-spamd
  else it will fail to start due to a syntax error.

20240326:
  AFFECTS: users of net/bird2
  AUTHOR: olivier@FreeBSD.org

  The net/bird2 default flavor has ben switched to netlink on FreeBSD >= 14.0
  There is not change for FreeBSD < 14.0 (default flavor is still rtsock)

20240319:
  AFFECTS: users of net/rdist6
  AUTHOR: cy@FreeBSD.org

  As of 52032b3d50c0 net/rdist6 will install its binary named rdist instead
  of rdist6. Base FreeBSD no longer has its own rdist binary. Therefore
  there is no need to rename the rdist6 binary to rdist6 to avoid confusion.
  The historical and default name of the rdist binary is "rdist".

20240318:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/unifi8
  AUTHOR: otis@FreeBSD.org

  The default MongoDB version dependency has been switched from 4.4 to 5.0.

  Although MongoDB 4.4 -> MongoDB 5.0 datafiles in-place upgrade seem to
  work, users are strongly recommended to take full backup of unifi
  database prior to upgrade and start with clean installation afterwards.

  See updating entry 20230310 for details.

20240316:
  AFFECTS: users of net/rabbitmq
  AUTHOR: dch@FreeBSD.org

  In preparation for upgrading to future RabbitMQ releases, users *must*
  enable all feature flags before upgrading stepwise to v3.12.13, to be
  able to migrate later to v3.13.0 when it is released in 2024Q2.

  See https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/upgrade for details.
