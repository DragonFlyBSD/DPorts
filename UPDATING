This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when upgrading
your ports.  We try our best to minimize these disruptions, but sometimes
they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each time
you update your ports collection, before attempting any port upgrades.

20141230:
  AFFECTS: users of deskutils/xpad
  AUTHOR: jgh@FreeBSD.org

  deskutils/xpad has been moved to deskutils/xpad3, since 4.x has been around
  for a while.

  Should you wish to stick with legacy branch at this time;

  # portmaster -o deskutils/xpad deskutils/xpad3

20141225:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/png
  AUTHOR: antoine@FreeBSD.org

  The PNG library has been updated to version 1.6.16.  Please rebuild all
  ports that depend on it.

  If you use portmaster:
        portmaster -r png
  If you use portupgrade:
        portupgrade -fr graphics/png

20141224:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/neon29
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  The port www/neon29 was renamed to www/neon and updated to version 0.30.1

  If you use pkg, simply upgrade:
  # pkg upgrade

  If you use portmaster, rebuild ports dependding on neon
  # portmaster -o www/neon www/neon29
  # portmaster -R -r neon

20141219:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/xorg and all xorg ports
  AUTHOR: dumbbell@FreeBSD.org

  The X.Org server (x11-servers/xorg-server) is updated to 1.14. All
  ports which provide X.Org drivers must be updated simultaneously, i.e.
  x11-drivers/xf86-*, emulators/virtualbox-ose-additions, net/tigervnc,
  etc.

  The input device autodetection backend is switched from HAL to devd.
  If you configure your keyboard layout through HAL .fdi files, you need
  to migrate this configuration to plain X.Org configuration files.

  Up-to-date instructions and a description of the changes brought by
  this update are detailed in a blog post:

20141219:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/xymon-server
  AUTHOR: feld@FreeBSD.org

  Xymon has been updated to 4.3.18. A major change is the replacement of
  the individual cgi shell scripts with symlinks to a cgi program written
  in C. This is to mitigate shellshock on Linux systems where the
  /bin/sh -> /bin/bash. FreeBSD users were not exposed except in the
  most unusual and unsupported circumstances. However, this is an
  important update for security. This change could break your
  configuration as Henrik describes here:

  > NOTE: Replacing the shell script wrappers means that the cgioptions.cfg
  > file is no longer processed as a shell script. The new wrapper works
  > fine with the default version of cgioptions.cfg, but it you have
  > modified it in a way that it relies on being processed by a shell, then
  > it will break.

20141219:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/abcde
  AUTHOR: gblach@FreeBSD.org

  In audio/abcde dependency has been changed from audio/py-eyed3-06
  to audio/py-eyed3. Before updating audio/abcde to 2.6 you must manually
  deinstall audio/py-eyed-06.

  # pkg delete -f py\*-eyed3-06

20141218:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openssh-portable
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  OpenSSH 6.7 disables some insecure ciphers by default, such as arcfour
  and blowfish. You may have clients using these over LAN where security is
  considered less important for the connection. For these cases you may need
  to update your Ciphers entry in your sshd_config to enable them again.

  See http://mgalgs.github.io/2014/10/22/enable-arcfour-and-other-fast-ciphers-on-recent-versions-of-openssh.html

20141217:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  Perl now links all .so it builds with libperl.so, it makes upgrading from one
  Perl major version to another way easier.  For binary package users, it means
  pkg upgrade will detect the libperl.so.x.yy change, and reinstall the
  affected packages.  For users using ports, it will save rebuild time as it's
  easier to detect what ports really need to be rebuilt.

  Ports users are encouraged to rebuild ports that install files in SITE_ARCH.
  If using Perl 5.18, run:

  With portupgrade:

    portupgrade -f `find /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/mach/5.18 -name '*.so'|xargs pkg which -qo|sort -u`

  With portmaster:

    portmaster `find /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/mach/5.18 -name '*.so'|xargs pkg which -qo|sort -u`

20141216:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openssh-portable, security/openssh-portable66
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  All patches have been fixed for version 6.7. It is no longer required to use
  the security/openssh-portable66 port.

  The LPK option was removed from security/openssh-portable as it has been
  deprecated since May 2013. Use AuthorizedKeysCommand as a replacement.

20141215:
  AFFECTS: users of comms/spandsp-devel
  AUTHOR: pawel@FreeBSD.org

  comms/spandsp has been upgraded to version 0.0.6
  comms/spandsp-devel is now deprecated and set for removal, all ports using
  it were converted to use newer comms/spandsp. Before upgrade you must
  remove comms/spandsp-devel so that ports can pick up new dependency.

  # pkg delete -f spandsp-devel

20141215:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/linux_base-f10 and emulators/linux_base-c6
  AUTHOR: sbruno@freebsd.org

  The CentOS ports are now the default for stable/10 (after revision 275807).
  See UPDATING entry 20141209 for details on migration of systems.

20141214:
  AFFECTS: users of TeXLive
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  Several scripts in print/texlive-base have been moved to
  devel/tex-kpathsea.  Upgrading them can fail because texlive-base
  depends on tex-kpathsea, and the new tex-kpathsea tries to install
  files which were installed by the old texlive-base.  The following
  error message indicates this situation:

    pkg-static: tex-kpathsea-6.2.0_1 conflicts with texlive-base-20140525_3 (installs files into the same place).  Problematic file: /usr/local/bin/kpsewhere

  To solve this problem, remove both of tex-kpathsea and texlive-base first
  and install the new versions:

   # pkg delete -f tex-kpathsea texlive-base

20141209:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/linux_base-f10 and emulators/linux_base-c6
  AUTHOR: xmj@freebsd.org

  The CentOS ports infrastructure has replaced Fedora 10 as default.

  1. Please delete all remaining f10 ports/packages:

     # pkg delete -f linux_base-f10 linux-f10-\*

  2. Persistently update the Linux kernel version in /etc/sysctl.conf:

     compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.18

    This step is necessary on all FreeBSD versions, apart from 11.0-CURRENT
    (after revision 271982).

  3. Reinstall all software depending on Linux emulation.
     As an example, reinstall linux-firefox:

     # portmaster -r linux-firefox
       or
     # portupgrade -f www/linux-firefox
       or
     # pkg install linux-firefox

  If difficulties are encountered, please follow the UPDATING entry 20140922
  but skip step 2 (OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT and OVERRIDE_LINUX_NONBASE_PORTS
  in /etc/make.conf). In case these steps do not fix the issues, please submit
  an issue report in Bugzilla and send an email to FreeBSD's emulation@ mailing
  list.

  Users who need to continue using Fedora 10 base and userland should do the
  following instead:

  1. Add these lines to /etc/make.conf:

      OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT=f10
      OVERRIDE_LINUX_NONBASE_PORTS=f10

  2. Downgrade the Linux kernel version in /etc/sysctl.conf on FreeBSD versions
     newer than and including 11.0-CURRENT (after revision 271982).

       compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.16

  This is all that is needed to continue using an existing Fedora 10 Linux base
  and userland.


20141208:
  AFFECTS: users of ports-mgmt/poudriere, ports-mgmt/poudriere-devel
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  8.4 jails created with Poudriere 3.1, or poudriere-devel-3.0.99.20141117
  should be recreated with 'jail -d' and 'jail -c'. This fixes pkg(8)
  crashes.

20141208:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql??-(server|client)
  AUTHOR: marino@FreeBSD.org

  PostgreSQL version 9.3 is now the default. To upgrade from a version
  lower than 9.3, follow the instructions on the PostgreSQL.org website.
  http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/interactive/upgrading.html
  Please note that the pg_upgrade program is installed by the
  databases/postgresql93-contrib port

  When using binary packages, if you only use the client port, you can
  issue the following command to follow the default version:

  # pkg set -o databases/postgresql92-client:databases/postgresql93-client

20141205:
  AFFECTS: users of polish/kadu
  AUTHOR: pawel@FreeBSD.org

  Before running kadu 1.x for the first time upstream developers
  advise to backup your ~/.kadu directory.

20141203:
  AFFECTS: users of ports-mgmt/poudriere
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  Poudriere has been updated to 3.1.0. See the release notes at
  https://github.com/freebsd/poudriere/wiki/release_notes_31 for
  information on changed features and required setup.

20141130:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/gettext (close to everyone)
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  The devel/gettext port has been split up in devel/gettext-runtime, a
  lightweight package containing runtime libraries, and devel/gettext-tools,
  a package containing developer tools.  The devel/gettext port still exists
  as a metaport.

  You must first delete the existing installation of gettext and then
  reinstall it.  This will break sudo, so you *must* do this in a root
  shell (sudo -i) if you use sudo.

  # pkg delete -f gettext
  # portmaster devel/gettext

  Or for portupgrade users:

  # pkg delete -f gettext
  # portinstall devel/gettext

  Or for binary users:

  # pkg delete -f gettext
  # pkg upgrade

20141127:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  There was a nasty bug introduced in the update below, it was introduced in
  SVN revision 373476 and corrected in 373485.  If you get errors looking like
  this one:

  ===>   Registering installation for p5-Params-Util-1.07_1 as automatic
  pkg-static: lstat(/usr/ports/devel/p5-Params-Util/work/stage/usr/local/./usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/mach/5.16/auto/Params/Util/.packlist): No such file or directory
  *** [fake-pkg] Error code 74

  You will have to wipe your ports tree clean.  If using portsnap, with:

    portsnap extract

  If using subversion:

    svn revert -R

20141127:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The .packlist files are back, if you upgraded all your p5- ports yesterday
  and need them, you will need to reinstall them again, see yesterday's update
  for instructions.

20141126:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/x264
  AUTHOR: xmj@FreeBSD.org

  With the recent split of multimedia/x264 in library and binary and library
  components, if an application that uses libx264 is updated before x264 itself,
  multimedia/libx264 will conflict with the existing x264 package. Delete
  this package before continuing any update that depends on it:

	# pkg delete -f x264

  Install the updated x264 and/or upgrade the other applications that
  depend on libx264, such as ffmpeg.

20141126:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The directories where Perl modules are installed has changed.  All
  affected ports' PORTREVISION have been bumped, so upgrading should
  be as painless as possible.  The old directories have been kept in
  the default Perl @INC to make it even more painless.

  The default Perl has been switched to lang/perl5.18.  These examples
  are for switching from lang/perl5.16, if you are running a different
  version, replace lang/perl5.16 with the origin of the Perl you have
  installed.

  Binary package users:

    # pkg upgrade -f

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
        pkgdb -Ff

    1) Reinstall new version of Perl (5.18):
        portupgrade -o lang/perl5.18 -f lang/perl5.16

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
        portupgrade -fr lang/perl5.18

  Portmaster users:
        portmaster -o lang/perl5.18 lang/perl5.16

        Conservative:
        portmaster p5-

        Comprehensive (but perhaps overkill):
        portmaster -r perl5-

  Note: If the "perl5-" glob matches more than one port you will need to specify
        the name of the installed Perl package explicitly.  You can get its name
        by running: pkg info perl5

20141125:
  AFFECTS: users of EFL libraries
  AUTHOR: gblach@FreeBSD.org

  EFL libraries has been merged into one port. Before installing devel/efl
  you must deinstall old EFL libraries:

  # pkg delete -f eina eet evas evas-\* ecore\* eio efreet embryo edje \
      ethumb emotion
  # make -C /usr/ports/devel/efl install clean

20141125:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-wm/e17-module*
  AUTHOR: gblach@FreeBSD.org

  Enlightenment has been updated to 0.19.1. Some of e-modules can't be build
  with updated Enlightenment, these modules has been marked as broken.
  E-modules which work with new Enlightenment has been renamed to
  x11-wm/e-module-*. To update these modules you must call the following
  commands (substituting the name of module in place *):

  # portmaster -o x11-wm/e-module-* x11-wm/e17-module-*
  # portmaster -o x11-wm/e-modules x11-wm/e17-modules
  or
  # portupgrade -fo x11-wm/e-module-* x11-wm/e17-module-*
  # portupgrade -fo x11-wm/e-modules x11-wm/e17-modules

20141123:
  AFFECTS: users of security/heimdal
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The header and library files have been moved from PREFIX/{include,lib} to
  PREFIX/{include,lib}/heimdal at r373047 to fix a library dependency
  confusion when software attempts to link a Heimdal library in base and
  an external library in LOCALBASE/lib at the same time.

  All of packages which depend on security/heimdal have to be recompiled
  and reinstalled because of this library location change.

20141119:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/gnome2, graphics/clutter and lang/vala
  AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  GNOME 3.14 was imported. Because this is a big change some manual help is
  needed. Please use the following instructions to update.

  Make a list of the installed ports:
  # pkg info > ~/installed-ports-list

  Delete the old and conflicting packages:
  # pkg delete clutter gnome-utils gnome-panel gnome-keyring vala-vapigen \
      guile gcalctool gnome-media libgnomekbd gnome-themes at-spi
  # pkg delete gnome-screensaver gnome-applets bug-buddy \
      evolution-exchange evolution-webcal gnome-system-tools \
      seahorse-plugins gnome-control-center

  For package users the following lines will be enough:
  # pkg upgrade
  # pkg install gnome3

  For ports users should do the following:
  # portmaster -a
  # portmaster x11/gnome3

  After these steps, check with the list we made earlier if your favorite
  ports are still installed, and reinstall them if needed.

20141117:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openssh-portable
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  Most of the optional patches for OpenSSH do not apply to the 6.7 update yet.
  The 6.6 version has been copied to security/openssh-portable66 if you require
  the use of one of the optional ports.

20141109:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/mediabrowser
  AUTHOR: woodsb02@gmail.com

  The default MediaBrowser database/configuration/logs/media metadata
  storage directory has moved from /usr/local/mediabrowser to
  /var/db/mediabrowser. Users are advised either to move the contents of
  the old directory to the new location, or to add a mediabrowser_data_dir
  entry to /etc/rc.conf.

20141029:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/libvirt
  AUTHOR: jgh@FreeBSD.org

  Application state and resource information has been changed from older
  path of /usr/local/var to /var. Users are advised to copy over contents
  of old var directory to new location if they wish to preserve resources
  from the old setup.

20141019:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/kde4-runtime
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE SC ports have been updated to 4.14.2. Several files have been
  moved between packages, therefore the following action is required
  before running any pkg/port upgrade utility:

  # pkg delete -f kde-runtime-4\*

20141008:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby19
  AUTHOR: swills@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 1.9 to 2.0.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 1.9 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 1.9 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ruby=1.9

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  software that uses ruby. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  upon how you manage your system.

  If you use pkgng, simply upgrade:
  # pkg upgrade

  If you use portmaster, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:
  # portmaster -o lang/ruby20 lang/ruby19
  # portmaster -R -r ruby-2.0

  If you use portupgrade, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:

  # pkg delete -f ruby ruby-iconv portupgrade
  # make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portupgrade install clean
  # pkg set -o lang/ruby19:lang/ruby20
  # portupgrade -x ruby-2.0.\* -fr lang/ruby20

20141003:
  AFFECTS: xorg users
  AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  The WITH_NEW_XORG setting has been activated by default on all versions
  of FreeBSD, which allows us to have packages for xorg 1.12 and kde4.

  Please be aware that on systems that only support syscons
  switching virtual terminals or exiting X
  results in a black screen or the last image of their desktop
  (like a screenshot) being presented.  Commands can still be typed blindly.

  Most, if not all, systems should be using vt(4) and this can be enabled
  by setting kern.vty=vt in /boot/loader.conf and reboot to activate.

20141001:
  AFFECTS: xorg users
  AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  The WITH_NEW_XORG setting has been activated by default on FreeBSD 10.0
  and above, which allows us to have packages for xorg 1.12 and kde4.

  Please be aware that on systems that only support syscons
  switching virtual terminals or exiting X
  results in a black screen or the last image of their desktop
  (like a screenshot) being presented.  Commands can still be typed blindly.

20140930:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/maildrop
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Due to the way pkg works please note that the configuration
  variables MAILDROP_SUID and MAILDROP_SGID, despite keeping their
  old names, are now required to contain a valid username and
  groupname existing on the system in which the package will be
  installed, while in the past numeric uids and gids worked fine.

  Wrong values will cause pkg to skip installing the setuid binaries
  on the system.

  Please check your configuration.

20140929:
  AFFECTS: users of comms/usbmuxd
  AUTHOR: avilla@FreeBSD.org

  libusbmuxd.so was split from comms/usbmuxd into comms/libusbmuxd.
  Remove usbmuxd before upgrading to avoid conflicts:

  # pkg delete -f usbmuxd

  If you need the daemon usbmuxd(1), you can reinstall the package
  after the upgrade.

20140928:
  AFFECTS: users of deskutils/calibre
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  The dependency on graphics/py-imaging in calibre has been changed
  to using the graphics/py-pillow port.

  Due to this change automatic updating of the port will not work
  correctly.

  It is suggested to remove calibre and py-imaging from the system
  and then reinstall calibre again using binary packages or ports.

20140927:
  AFFECTS: users of net/foreman-proxy
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  In version 1.6 Foreman Smart Proxy splits its configuration into multiple
  ruby files located in PREFIX/etc/foreman-proxy/settings.d.
  The configuration of each service (dhcp, dhs, bmc, etc.) has been moved
  into a dedicated file.

  You can use a bundled script to convert your old settings to new settings:
  PREFIX/share/foreman/extra/migrate_settings.rb

20140926:
  AFFECTS: users of shells/bash
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  Bash supports a feature of exporting functions in the environment with
  export -f.  Running bash with exported functions in the environment will
  then import those functions into the environment of the script being ran.
  This resulted in security issues CVE-2014-6271 and CVE-2014-7169, commonly
  known as "shellshock".  It also can result in poorly written scripts being
  tricked into running arbitrary commands.

  To fully mitigate against this sort of attack we have applied a non-upstream
  patch to disable this functionality by default.  You can execute bash
  with --import-functions to allow it to import functions from the
  environment.  The default can also be changed in the port by selecting the
  IMPORTFUNCTIONS option.

20140926:
  AFFECTS: users of net/asterisk and net/asterisk11
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  The asterisk ports have been modified to have the LUA option
  turned on by default to make such functionality available to users
  of binary packages.

  Some care should be taken before upgrading by people not using Lua
  to avoid the sample extensions.lua file from being loaded on reload
  after updating the asterisk port/pkg.

  Users compiling from ports not interested in LUA support are advised
  to disable the option before updating.

  People using binary packages(or not wanting to disable the LUA
  option in the port) not using the Lua functionality should add:

  noload => pbx_lua.so

  to the PREFIX/etc/asterisk/modules.conf file, if using the
  autoload=yes option in that same file. People not autoloading
  modules don't need to perform any special action.

  If asterisk is rebooted and the pbx_lua module gets loaded on a
  system were it should not, it will load the example extensions.lua
  configuration file adding unexpected logic to your dialplan. In
  such a case following the above steps and reloading asterisk will
  fix the problem.

20140922:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/linux_base-f10 and emulators/linux_base-c6
  AUTHOR: xmj@FreeBSD.org

  The complete drop-in replacement linux-c6 port infrastructure is in
  ports and will shortly replace the current linux-f10- ports as default.

  To switch to the linux-c6 infrastructure:

  0. Back up all your vital information!
  1. Remove the current linux base port and all linux-f10- ports:
       # pkg delete -f linux_base-f10 linux-f10-\*
  2. Add these lines to /etc/make.conf:
       OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT=c6
       OVERRIDE_LINUX_NONBASE_PORTS=c6
  3. Make sure no Linux application is running.
  4. Update the Linux kernel version in /etc/sysctl.conf:
       compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.18
     Make it take effect immediately:
       # sysctl compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.18
  5. Install emulators/linux-c6.

  These steps are usually sufficient. If there are difficulties, expand
  step 1 to:

  1a. Remove all ports which depend on the linux base port.
  1b. Remove the linux base port.
  1c. Clean the /compat/linux/ directory.

  If there are any other difficulties not fixed by these extended steps,
  please submit an issue report in Bugzilla and send an email to
  FreeBSD's emulation@ mailing list.

20140909:
  AFFECTS: users seeing build errors about missing *.la files
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  We are in the process of adjusting or, if possible, removing libtool archives
  (*.la files) from all ports because they can otherwise cause overlinking
  between packages.  This is the problem where in the dependency chain A->B->C
  an extra link is added from A to C even if A does not use C directly.  This
  makes some updates to port C expensive because then both A and B have to be
  rebuilt instead of just B.

  This is mostly behind the scenes work that you won't notice.  In fact most
  ports have already been converted.  You may however run into build errors
  about missing *.la files if a port update in the past went wrong and left
  behind *.la files with references to other *.la files that are no longer
  there.  In this case, please run the following command:

  find /usr/local/lib -name '*.la' | xargs grep -l 'libfoo\.la' | xargs pkg which
  (Replace libfoo\.la with the *.la file that is missing.)

  This command will print a list of *.la files that refer to the missing *.la
  file and what package they belong to.  First, where it says "not found in
  the database", remove the *.la file.  After removing all such files, where
  it says "installed by package X", rebuild X.  Eventually the list printed by
  that command will be empty and the build error should be gone.

  - Users need to run 'pkg update -f' and 'pkg check -Ba' after upgrading to
    pkg-1.3.7 and before updating any other packages. This avoids needing to
    reinstall anything not needed due to changed shlibs.
     For binary package users:
      # pkg install ports-mgmt/pkg
      # pkg update -f
      # pkg check -Ba
      # pkg upgrade
     For port users:
      # make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/pkg build deinstall install clean
      # pkg check -Ba
  - People building packages for serving to other systems need to rebuild
    all packages with 1.3.7.

  AFFECTS: users of graphics/libjpeg-turbo
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  libjpeg-turbo installs its own unique library (libturbojpeg.so) and
  a drop-in replacement for libjpeg.so. The drop-in replacement has been
  split off into graphics/jpeg-turbo; libjpeg-turbo now installs only
  libturbojpeg.so.

  If you were using the libjpeg.so from graphics/libjpeg-turbo, you
  should install graphics/jpeg-turbo AFTER upgrading the libjpeg-turbo
  port.

20140823:
  AFFECTS: users of TeXLive
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  TeXLive in Ports Collection has been updated to TL2014.

  When upgrading print/texlive-base on a system which has
  TL2012 packages, the following error may occur:

  pkg-static: texlive-base-20140525 conflicts with texlive-texmf-20120701_4

  Please remove texlive-texmf-20120701_4 first in that case.

  If you still get a similar "conflict of install files" error,
  please remove all of tex-* and texlive-* packages and then
  see if ${PREFIX}/share/texmf-dist directory are empty.  If not,
  installing TeXlive can fail.  Removing files in the directory
  manually will fix the installation problem.

  AFFECTS: users of databases/db4, databases/db4[1-7]*
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  HEADS UP: for some applications that store their data in Berkeley DB
  databases, you may have to export the data before the upgrade and
  reload it afterwards.  Detailed instructions are at
  <https://wiki.freebsd.org/Ports/BerkeleyDBCleanup>.

  The older databases/db4* ports providing versions 4.0 to 4.7
  inclusively have been removed, and 4.8 has been deprecated.
  The default Berkeley DB version is now 5.3.
  (6.x has a different license, but will be eligible as default on
  systems that build ports from source and have db6 installed.)
    All enabled and working ports have been changed such that they use
  Berkeley DB 4.8 or newer, and an -exp run has been made.

  After you have performed the first steps from the Wiki documentation,
  and have arrived at a step that reads "build all applications", then
  type as privileged user and without the hash sign:

  # Tools/scripts/BDB-upgrade-helper.sh

  The helper script requires that ports-mgmt/portmaster or
  .../portupgrade is installed, will try to upgrade your applications
  with either of these tools (portmaster preferred), and if that succeeds,
  it will attempt to delete the packages if confirmed interactively.

20140815:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/ilmbase and graphics/OpenEXR
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  The OpenEXR and ilmbase (Industrial Light and Magic) shared object
  names have changed.  You must rebuild all packages that require either
  of these libraries, by using one of these commands:

  # portmaster -r ilmbase -r OpenEXR
    or
  # portupgrade -fr graphics/ilmbase graphics/OpenEXR

  The PORTREVISIONs of all ports that require ilmbase and/or OpenEXR
  have been bumped.

20140810:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ghc and */hs-*
  AUTHOR: haskell@FreeBSD.org

  The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compiler has been updated to version
  7.8.3 and Haskell Platform to 2014.2.0.0.  Hence it is recommended to
  rebuild or reinstall all the dependent ports and the lang/ghc port
  itself by one of the following commands:

  # portmaster -w -r ghc
    or
  # portupgrade -fr lang/ghc

  If you use pkg(8) then it is just safer to remove all the GHC-dependent
  packages along with GHC and reinstall everything from scratch.
  Something alone these lines may work:

  # pkg query "%ro" > ghc-pkgs.txt
  # pkg delete -y lang/ghc
  # pkg install -y `cat ghc-pkgs.txt | grep -Ev "/hs-(haskeline|terminfo|transformers|xhtml)"

20140803:
  AFFECTS: users of security/p5-openxpki
  AUTHOR: wg@FreeBSD.org

  The following ports have been integrated into security/p5-openxpki:
    security/p5-openxpki-client
    security/p5-openxpki-client-scep
    security/p5-openxpki-deployment

  Before update make sure to remove the old packages:

  # pkg remove security/p5-openxpki-client
  # pkg remove security/p5-openxpki-client-scep
  # pkg remove security/p5-openxpki-deployment

20140802:
  AFFECTS: users of astro/stellarium
  AUTHOR: danfe@FreeBSD.org

  Stellarium was updated to version 0.13.0.  It's a new major release, and
  it is based on Qt version 5 now.  For those who are not comfortable with
  upgrading to the new Qt, previous Stellarium version (0.12.4) was copied
  over to `astro/stellarium-qt4' port.

20140731:
  AFFECTS: users of www/ajaxplorer
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  The ajaxplorer project was renamed to pydio.

  Due to this update some manual steps will need to be performed
  after updating the port.

  IMPORTANT: Perform a backup of the ajaxplorer installation and
  the databases backing it(if you're using that feature).

  First manually remove the ajaxplorer port and install www/pydio
  afterwards.

  Further steps will be available in the pkg-message, which can
  be shown with these commands:

  # pkg info -D pydio

  # pkg_info -D pydio

  Please also read the upgrading notes at:

  http://pyd.io/pydio-core-5.2.0#Upgrading

20140728:
  AFFECTS: users of net/GeoIP
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  GeoIP no longer ships with the GeoIP database. To continue using GeoIP,
  you MUST fetch the database after upgrading by running geoipupdate.sh.

20140727:
  AFFECTS: users of comms/qpage
  AUTHOR: marino@FreeBSD.org

  The default configure file location has changed from
  ${LOCALBASE}/etc/qpage.cf to ${LOCALBASE}/etc/qpage.conf
  You will likely want to move the old configure file to the new location
  after updating if it contains custom settings.

20140725:
  AFFECTS: users of cad/netgen
  AUTHOR: stephen@FreeBSD.org

  Before you update this port the old one should be removed.  (This is
  because the build may try to link to libraries that are in
  ${LOCALBASE}/lib rather than in ${WRKSRC}.)

20140724:
  AFFECTS: users of dns/mydns-ng
  AUTHOR: danilo@FreeBSD.org

  The dns/mydns-ng port no longer has the suffix (-mysql|-pgsql). Before
  you update this port the old one must be removed:

  pkg remove mydns-ng-mysql
    or
  pkg remove mysql-ng-pgsql

20140723:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/libevent

  libevent1 has been replaced by libevent2 via the compatibility layer.
  All applications that used libevent1 must be rebuilt.

  Please remove libevent1 before upgrading, by running:

	pkg delete -f libevent

20140723:
  AFFECTS: users of security/scanlogd
  AUTHOR: tgyurci@gmail.com

  The security/scanlogd port now creates scanlogd user and group. Previous
  scanlogd user and group must be removed before updating to not conflict
  with the one created by the port:

	pw userdel scanlogd
	pw groupdel scanlogd

20140723:
  AFFECTS: users of TeX
  AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  TeXLive is now the default teX provider.
  Please remove all TeX-related packages based on teTeX.

20140722:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/exim
  AUTHOR: vsevolod@FreeBSD.org

  The behaviour of expansion of arguments to math comparison functions (<,
  <=, =, =>, >) was unexpected, expanding the values twice. Please update
  your configuration if you have relied on such an expansion.

20140722:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/mediainfo
  AUTHOR: sunpoet@FreeBSD.org

  mediainfo has been split into 3 ports: libzen, libmediainfo and mediainfo.
  Please uninstall mediainfo before you update this port.

20140722:
  AFFECTS: users of games/bsdgames
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  Please disregard any prior instructions about moving your game data to
  /usr/local/var/games. If you have done this, please move it back to
  /var/games.

20140714:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/db6
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  Oracle Berkeley DB 6 has been upgraded to version 6.1.19.  Since the
  previous 6.0 version, the log file format has changed in 6.1.
  Depending on applications used, you may need to take action BEFORE you
  upgrade.  For details, please see the online upgrade manual at
  <http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17076_04/html/upgrading/upgrade_process.html>
  <http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17076_04/html/installation/upgrade_61_toc.html>

  Note: if you've got Apache installed and depending on db6, you may
  need to upgrade it separately BEFORE upgrading other ports, such as
  Apache modules.

  After that, you must rebuild all applications that link to db6 because
  the shared library name has changed with the upgrade.  To do that:

  If you use portmaster:
        portmaster -w -r db6-
  If you use portupgrade:
        portupgrade -fr databases/db6

20140714:
  AFFECTS: users of net/linphone-base
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  Linphone has been updated to version 3.7.0 and the linphone-base port
  has been split into separate components.  You must first delete the
  linphone-base package before you can update ports that depend on it.

  pkg del -f linphone-base
    or
  pkg_delete -f linphone-base\*

20140713:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix-current

  associated with your Postfix setup before updating.

20140713:
  AFFECTS: users of www/apache22
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  The default version was changed from www/apache22 to www/apache24,
  pre-build apache modules and web applications will also reflect this!

  In case ports are build by yourself and apache22 is required
  use the following command to keep apache22 as default.

  # echo "DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=apache=2.2" >> /etc/make.conf

20140710:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/rust
  AUTHOR: robak@FreeBSD.org

20140709:
  AFFECTS: users of security/pam-pgsql
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  The pam_pgsql.so module is now installed in PREFIX/lib (/usr/local/lib)
  instead of /usr/lib.

20140627:
  AFFECTS: Users of Java
  AUTHOR: swills@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of OpenJDK has been updated from 1.6 to 1.7. To update,
  users of Java will need to rebuild all ports that depend on Java:

  If you use pkg (regardless of if you build ports from source or install
  binary packages):
  # pkg set -o java/openjdk6:java/openjdk7

  If you use portmaster to build ports from source:

  # portmaster -o java/openjdk7 openjdk6
  # portmaster -R -r openjdk

  If you use portupgrade to build ports from source:

  # portupgrade -fo java/openjdk7 java/openjdk6

  If you use pkg to install prebuilt binary packages:

  # pkg install -fR java/openjdk7

  If you wish to keep the 1.6 version as default, add the following lines to
  your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep OpenJDK 1.6 as default version.
  #
  JAVA_PREFERRED_PORTS=JAVA_PORT_NATIVE_OPENJDK_JDK_1_6

20140627:
  AFFECTS: users of security/amavisd-milter
  AUTHOR: delphij@FreeBSD.org

20140626:
  AFFECTS: users of comms/smstools3
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  The smstools3 startup screen has been modified to allow smsd to
  change uid/gid by itself. The rc options smsd_logfile, smsd_user
  and smsd_group are not supported anymore, user, group and log
  filename should be specified in the configuration file.

  The sample configuration file has been updated to have defaults
  equivalent to the old ones.

20140624:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/p5-Bucardo
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The bucardo_ctl script has been renamed to bucardo, so, to follow the naming,
  the bucardo_ctl_enable rc variable has been renamed to bucardo_enable.

20140622:
  AFFECTS: users of security/gpgme
  AUTHOR: jhale@FreeBSD.org

  If you have both security/gnupg AND security/gnupg1 installed, gpgme will
  now automatically detect and use security/gnupg.  Specifically, it will
  search for gpgconf(1) first and use the paths for the binaries provided
  by it.  Failing that, it will search for a binary named "gpg".

  It is no longer possible to specify the location of the gpg binary at
  buildtime to differentiate between version 1.x and version 2.x.  The port
  options GNUPG1 and GNUPG2 now merely add their respective versions of gnupg
  as build and runtime dependencies.

20140618:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/m17n-* textproc/*m17n*
  AUTHOR: Nikola Lecic <nikola.lecic@anthesphoria.net>

  devel/m17n-db now incorporates a set of user-contributed input methods and
  a conversion script, formerly available through textproc/m17n-contrib.
  Delete textproc/m17n-contrib first and then update/install devel/m17n-db.

20140616:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/subversion
  AUTHOR: lev@FreeBSD.org

  The subversion port has been overhauled. Some optional parts were extracted
  into separate ports. These ports are:

  www/mod_dav_svn
    instead of option MOD_DAV_SVN.
  security/subversion-gnome-keyring
    instead of option GNOME_KEYRING.
  security/subversion-kwallet
    instead of option KDE_KWALLET.

  If you used devel/subversion with one (or more) of these non-standard
  options, you should install the appropriate port(s) after upgrading
  subversion.

  "mod_dontdothat" is installed unconditionally by www/mod_dav_svn port (it
  depended on the TOOLS option before), but is not activated by default, you
  may need to edit apache's configuration file.

  The devel/subversion port now installs svndiff, svndiff3 and svndiff4
  commands if TOOLS option is enabled. They was skipped before.
  The official names "diff", "diff3" and "diff4" are prefixed with "svn" to
  avoid conflicts with base and other diff versions.

  All libraries and binaries are now stripped if the MAINTAINER_DEBUG
  option is not selected (including all sub-ports, like bindings
  and mod_dav_svn).

20140611:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/icu
  AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  icu has been updated to 53.1. Please rebuild all ports that depend on it

  AFFECTS: users of dns/dnscrypt-proxy
  AUTHOR: feld@FreeBSD.org

  The 1.4.0 update to dns/dnscrypt-proxy introduced a privilege
  separation capability utilizing the new _dnscrypt-proxy user.
  The home directory for this user was misconfigured as /nonexistent.
  The dnscrypt-proxy server will try to chroot to _dnscrypt-proxy's home
  directory and fail to start. If you are affected you will need to
  change _dnscrypt-proxy's home directory to /var/empty:

  # pw usermod _dnscrypt-proxy -d /var/empty

  AFFECTS: users of databases/mariadb55*
  AUTHOR: grembo@FreeBSD.org

  The mariadb55-client and mariadb55-server port have been changed to
  respect hier(7) and behave like the mysql ports. Therefore mysql-server
  and mysql monitor will refuse to start if my.cnf exists in /etc or
  /etc/mysql.

  In case you're affected, please move /etc/my.cnf to /usr/local/etc and/or
  /etc/mysql/my.cnf to /usr/local/etc/mysql.

20140520:
  AFFECTS: users of security/dropbear
  AUTHOR: ak@FreeBSD.org

  AFFECTS: users of ports-mgmt/portshaker
  AUTHOR: romain@FreeBSD.org

  ports-mgmt/portshaker was updated to avoid creating an aditional 'ports'
  subdirectory when merging to a poudriere_tree without ZFS, so that
  portshaker's default location matches poudriere's default location.

  Users of poudriere on non-ZFS systems should not anymore have to pass extra
  options to poudriere for it to find the ports tree.

20140506:
  AFFECTS: users of security/yassl
  AUTHOR: gahr@FreeBSD.org

  security/yassl was moved to security/cyassl to match the original package

  from 1.9.x/1.10.x to 1.11.x.

20140420:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba4
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  Samba4 port now re-uses the same logic and startup script as Samba41. So,
  to get net/samba4 runing you need to rename samba4_enable in /etc/rc.conf
  to the samba_sever_enable.

  samba_server_enable="YES"

  Startup script tries it's best to guess which out of samba/nmbd/smbd/winbindd
  daemons have to be started, but you can fine tune this by specifying them in
  rc.conf, just make sure that samba_server_enable is enabled(see entry for 20121022).

20140416:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/xorg graphics/dri graphics/libGL and related ports
  AUTHOR: x11@FreeBSD.org

  The default xorg version has been switched on FreeBSD 10-STABLE and
  FreeBSD 9-STABLE.

  To upgrade graphics/libGL, graphics/dri and related MESA ports, it is
  necessary to first remove the old versions of those ports.
  No special upgrade procedure is needed for xorg ports but it is
  necessary to recompile all xorg drivers (xf86-*) and other ports that
  depend on the xserver version, including
  emulators/virtualbox-ose-additions.  Portrevisions have been bumped
  where needed, but users of drivers not in the ports tree will need to
  recompile those.

  If it is important to stay on the old versions, it is possible to
  specify WITHOUT_NEW_XORG= in /etc/make.conf to get the old xorg

           x11/libxcb and graphics/freeglut
  AUTHOR: x11@FreeBSD.org and gnome@FreeBSD.org

  The library version of the above libraries has been brought in line
  with what upstream expects. To do this all users of these ports need
  to be rebuilt. Portrevisions have been bumped as a consequence.

  # portmaster -r freetype2 -r libxml2 -r pixman -r freeglut -r libxcb
  or
  # portupgrade -rf freetype2 libxml2 pixman freeglut libxcb

  AFFECTS: Users of mod_python3
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  www/mod_python3 was renamed to www/mod_python33, additional www/mod_python35
  with support for apache24 was added to the portstree.

  To reflect the new port location use:

  pkgng users:
  # pkg set -o www/mod_python3:www/mod_python33

  portmaster users:
  # portmaster -o www/mod_python33 www/mod_python3

  AFFECTS: Users of dmd 1.X and dmd 2.x.
  AUTHOR: cy@FreeBSD.org

  lang/dmd and lang/dmd2 have switched places. Dmd 1.x is no longer supported
  by digitalmars.com and is now the secondary dmd port in the collection.
  Dmd2 is the primary port. What this means to dmd users is that dmd1 is now
  used to invoke dmd 1.x and the dmd command (instead of dmd2) now invokes
  dmd 2.x.

20140413:
  AFFECTS: Users of Python and pkg >= 1.2.7_1
  AUTHOR: koobs@FreeBSD.org

  There have been reports of the following error when upgrading Python ports:

    pkg-static: Plist error, directory listed as a file: <name>.egg-info

  The cause is an outdated or unpatched version of setuptools or distribute
  installed by the user, or leftover from previous upgrades being used during
  the `setup.py install` phase. pkg >= 1.2.7_1 now generates an error where
  previously it did not.

  Users should inspect their ${LOCALBASE}/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages
  directory, and remove any entries that reference versions of
  setuptools or distribute *not* provided by ports or packages.

  Examples of entries that may be removed are:

    1) distribute-0.6.35-py2.7.egg
    2) setuptools-0.6c11-py2.7.egg
    3) *Any* version of setuptools directly from PyPi via pip or easy_install

  AFFECTS: users of net/rabbitmq
  AUTHOR: olgeni@FreeBSD.org

  This release changes the behaviour of the default "guest" user.

  Previously the guest user could be accessed from any network
  location. In RabbitMQ 3.3.0 and later, the guest user can only
  be accessed via localhost by default.

  Any other users you create will not (by default) be restricted
  in this way.

  See http://www.rabbitmq.com/access-control.html for more information.

  AFFECTS: users of textproc/elasticsearch
  AUTHOR: tj@FreeBSD.org

  Elasticsearch has been updated to version 1.1.0. If you are updating
  from a version prior to 1.0.0 you will need to do a full cluster
  shutdown for this update as it can not be performed in a rolling
  fashion.

  AFFECTS: users of print/cups-client and print/cups-image
  AUTHOR: bsam@FreeBSD.org

  CUPS ports have been updated to version 1.7.1. A file has migrated from
  cups-image port to cups-client. Before upgrading you should force the
  removal of cups-image port, otherwise it will conflict with the new one.

  pkg users:
  # pkg delete -f cups-image\*

  other users:
  # pkg_delete -f cups-image\*

  2. Install/upgrade other cups* packages.

  If cups-filters complains about a missing cups/raster.h include,
  try reinstalling the cups-client package.

20140327:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/php5 and lang/php55 with Apache module
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  The Apache PHP module has been separated from the main PHP port.
  If you had the APACHE OPTION selected, you have to perform the
  following steps:

  1) update your lang/php* options (i.e. 'make config')
  2) rebuild lang/php* port
  3) install www/mod_php* port

  It is *mandatory* to build both ports with the same DEBUG and ZTS
  options, so if you have a threaded Apache (i.e. worker or event MPM)
  you have to select the ZTS option in lang/php* port.

20140322:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/apr1
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  APR was updated to 1.5.0, BDB requirement was bumped to 48+

  AFFECTS: users of net/openistgt
  AUTHOR: jpaetzel@FreeBSD.org

  Between istgt supporting target reload, and iscsid using CTL there is no
  point to this port.  As such it has been deleted without warning, since
  the support for it is as best questionable.

  pkgng users:

  # pkg set -o net/openistgt:net/istgt

  portmaster users:

  # portmaster -o net/istgt net/openistgt
  # portmaster -r istgt

  AFFECTS: users of devel/py-setuptools dependent ports
  AUTHOR: sunpoet@FreeBSD.org

  devel/py-setuptools is being used for every python ports (if USE_PYDISTUTILS
  defined) since r336553. Due to PKGORIGIN limitation, we cannot build one
  python port with python27 and the other with python33 since they require
  different setuptools versions which have same PKGORIGIN. With the addition
  of py-setuptools{27,32,33}, we could now have py27-foo and py33-bar coexist
  in one system.

  Note that this is only a short-term solution. It does not help if you need
  coexistence of one port with different python versions, e.g. py27-foo and
  py33-foo.

  Please rebuild all ports that depend on devel/py-setuptools and use
  devel/py-setuptools{27,32,33} instead.

  XX represents python version (27, 32 or 33) in the following steps.

  pkgng users:

  # pkg set -o devel/py-setuptools:devel/py-setuptoolsXX

  portmaster users:

  # portmaster -o devel/py-setuptoolsXX devel/py-setuptools
  # portmaster -r py\*setuptools

  portupgrade users:

  # portupgrade -o devel/py-setuptoolsXX -f devel/py-setuptools
  # portupgrade -fr devel/py-setuptools

  AFFECTS: users of editors/vim
  AUTHOR: sunpoet@FreeBSD.org

  The editors/vim port has been reworked to simplify option handling. In UI
  option group, a new option (CONSOLE) was added for users who do not need
  GUI support. This option is off by default. You might encounter install
  or package failures with "old" option setting. Please run "make config" to
  modify your setting.

20140219:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/docbook*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The textproc/docbook-* ports have been consolidated into two ports
  textproc/docbook-sgml and textproc/docbook-xml.

  Before upgrading you should force the removal of the existing ports, they
  will conflict with the new ones.

  pkg users can run:

    pkg delete -f docbook-xml\* docbook-sk\* docbook\[2345\]\?\?-\* docbook-4\*

  the other users can run:

  AFFECTS: users of misc/kdehier4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE4_PREFIX has been changed from /usr/local/kde4 to /usr/local.
  All ports that depends on kdehier4 must be reinstalled.
  PORTREVISION for affected ports has been increased, upgrading tools
  (portmaster, pkg) should handle this update without manual intervention.
  Please check /usr/local/kde4 for leftovers after upgrade. If you don't
  have locally modified files, e.g. under /usr/local/kde4/etc, you may
  safely remove /usr/local/kde4.

20140214:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.12
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  Perl 5.12 has been removed.  The default Perl is lang/perl5.16.

  pkg(8) users:
    1) Update the origin to point to 5.16:
       pkg set -o lang/perl5.12:lang/perl5.16

    2) Upgrade perl and all dependencies:
       pkg install -Rf lang/perl5.16

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
       pkgdb -Ff

    1) Reinstall new version of Perl (5.16):
       portupgrade -o lang/perl5.16 -f lang/perl5.12

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
       portupgrade -fr lang/perl5.16

  Portmaster users:
    portmaster -o lang/perl5.16 lang/perl5.12

    Conservative:
      portmaster p5-

    Comprehensive (but perhaps overkill):
      portmaster -r perl-

    Note: If the "perl-" glob matches more than one port specify the name of
      the Perl directory in /var/db/pkg explicitly.  Also, depending on when
      perl 5.12 was installed last, the prefix may be perl-, perl5- or
      perl5.12-.

20140211:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/php* database/postgresql* database/mysql* www/apache*

20140113:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba41
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  With the introduction of Samba 4.1 corresponding port lost SWAT support
  and made WINBIND support mandatory. As samba4 introduced additional 'samba'
  daemon to the tripplet of nmbd/smbd/winbindd to avoid confusion startup
  script for samba41 was renamed to 'samba_server'. To start the whole band
  up it's enough to add to the rc.conf:

  samba_server_enable="YES"

  Startup script tries it's best to guess which out of samba/nmbd/smbd/winbindd
  daemons have to be started, but you can fine tune this by specifying them in
  rc.conf, just make sure that samba_server_enable is enabled(see entry for 20121022).

20140112:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/libical
  AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  The libical port was updated to 1.0.0. Due to the shared library bump
  and the removal of the .la file, all ports that use libical need to be
  rebuilt.

  # portmaster -r libical

  # portupgrade -fr libical
   or
  # pkg install -fR libical

  AFFECTS: users of lang/go
  AUTHOR: jlaffaye@FreeBSD.org

  Third party Go packages installed via the ports tree are no longer installed
  in GOROOT (PREFIX/go) but in a specific path: PREFIX/share/go

  Affected ports had their PORTREVISION bumped.
  To reinstall these packages via the ports tree, it is needed to deinstall
  them first (the build will fail if the `go` command detects that they
  already exists in GOROOT).

  If you are using these third party Go packages for local Go development,
  you have to add this new path to your GOPATH environment variable.

  option was previously unset.

  The RAR decompression codec, whose source code has a more restrictive
  license that forbids its use for creating RAR archives, has been moved to
  a separate port, archivers/p7zip-codec-rar.
