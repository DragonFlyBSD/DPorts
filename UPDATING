This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when upgrading
your ports.  We try our best to minimize these disruptions, but sometimes
they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each time
you update your ports collection, before attempting any port upgrades.

20170628:
  AFFECTS: users of www/node
  AUTHOR: bhughes@freebsd.org

  The www/node port has been updated to Node.js v8.1.2, the latest
  upstream release. This is a major release, including many significant
  changes. Users are encouraged to read the release announcements before
  upgrading:

  https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v8.0.0/
  https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v8.1.0/

20170626:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/zabbix24*
  AUTHOR: dbaio@FreeBSD.org

  Zabbix 2.4 has reached end of life and net-mgmt/zabbix24* ports have been
  removed. Users that have not yet moved to a newer version, should use now
  net-mgmt/zabbix3-* (LTS release) or net-mgmt/zabbix32-* (Standard release).

  See more info about Zabbix releases here:
  http://www.zabbix.com/life_cycle_and_release_policy

20170624:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/dcc-dccd
  AUTHOR: ultima@FreeBSD.org

  The ALT_HOME option was removed in 1.3.159_1. If this option is being
  used, please be sure to move the old home directory, /var/dcc to
  ${PREFIX}/dcc.

20170624:
  AFFECTS: users of net/rabbitmq
  AUTHOR: olgeni@FreeBSD.org

  The rabbitmq-3.6.10_1 port has been changed to use version 19 of
  the Erlang runtime, because RabbitMQ is not yet compatible with
  version 20.

  Upgrades to the previous rabbitmq-3.6.10 must be avoided as
  they can lead to data corruption due to changes in Erlang 20.

20170622:
  AFFECTS: users of database/postgresql* and other software using PostgreSQL to run
  AUTHOR: tz@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of PostgreSQL has been switched from 9.3 to 9.5.
  The upgrade procedure can use up twice the space the databases
  currently needs. If you have a big amount of stored data take a
  closer look at the manpage of pg_upgrade for avoidance and/or
  speedup of the upgrade.

  The upgrade instructions consider a basic usage and do not match
  complex scenarious like replication, sharding or similar.
  
  Upgrade instructions:

  First stop your PostgreSQL, create PostgreSQL-binaries and backup your data.
  If you have another Version of PostgreSQL installed, for example 9.3.12, your
  files are named accourding to this.
  
  # service postgresql stop
  # pkg create postgresql93-server postgresql93-contrib
  # mkdir /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # tar xf postgresql93-server-9.3.17.txz -C /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # tar xf postgresql93-contrib-9.3.17.txz -C /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # mv /usr/local/pgsql/data /usr/local/pgsql/data93
  # pkg delete -f databases/postgresql93-server databases/postgresql93-contrib databases/postgresql93-client

  Now update PostgreSQL:

    pkg user:
    # pkg install databases/postgresql95-server databases/postgresql95-contrib
    # pkg upgrade

    Portmaster users:
    # portmaster databases/postgresql95-server databases/postgresql95-contrib
    # portmaster -a

    Portupgrade users:
    # portinstall databases/postgresql95-server databases/postgresql95-contrib
    # portupgrade -a

  After installing the new PostgreSQL version you need to convert
  all your databases to new version:
  
  # service postgresql initdb
  # su -l pgsql -c "pg_upgrade -b /tmp/pg-upgrade/usr/local/bin/ -d /usr/local/pgsql/data93/ -B /usr/local/bin/ -D /usr/local/pgsql/data/"

  Now the migration is finished. You can start PostgreSQL again with:

  # service postgresql start

20170614:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/calligra
  AUTHOR: groot@kde.org

  Calligra has been updated to 3.0.1, which is a KDE Frameworks 5 (KF5)
  based application. Calligra now uses Qt5 and KF5. The translations have
  been merged (upstream) into the application, so separate language /
  translation ports are no longer provided. Krita has been split out
  (upstream) into a separate application, which is packaged as 
  graphics/krita. Kexi, the visual database applications creator,
  is packaged separately as databases/kexi.

  Users of Calligra are encouraged to install Krita and Kexi separately,
  and to report issues with the upgrade to kde@.

20170613:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/ejabberd
  AUTHOR: ashish@FreeBSD.org

  After update to 17.04, there is an issue[1] expected with S2S connections,
  which can be resolved by adding 'mod_s2s_dialback: {}' to 'modules' section
  of configuration file.

  [1] - https://github.com/processone/ejabberd/issues/1700  

20170603:
  AFFECTS: users of www/kanboard
  AUTHOR: joneum@FreeBSD.org

  After update to 1.0.44, there are following breaking changes:
  * Move calendar to external plugin: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-calendar
  * Move Gantt charts to external plugin: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-gantt
  * Move Gravatar to external plugin: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-gravatar

20170602:
  AFFECTS: users of Qt 5 in presence of binutils
  AUTHOR: amdmi3@FreeBSD.org

  gold linker from binutils 2.28 may produce duplicate library
  symbols, which makes shared libraries created with it not usable
  with conventional ld linker.

  This affects Qt, as qt5-qmake will detect gold and use it to build
  Qt libraries. Broken libQt5Core will be produced and ports which
  depend on it will then fail to link with the following errors:

    ...lib/libQt5Core.so:(.dynamic+0x27ac8): multiple definition of `__bss_start at Qt_5'
    ...lib/libQt5Core.so:(.dynamic+0x27ac8): first defined here
    ...lib/libQt5Core.so:(.dynamic+0x27ac8): multiple definition of `_edata at Qt_5'
    ...lib/libQt5Core.so:(.dynamic+0x27ac8): first defined here
    ...lib/libQt5Core.so:(.dynamic+0x2b2d0): multiple definition of `_end at Qt_5'

  Qt5 was fixed to ignore gold. If you see these errors, you
  need to rebuild qt5-qmake, then all qt5-* ports.

20170529:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/dsbmd
  AUTHOR: mk@freeshell.de

  Due to new configuration variables and semantic changes, users of dsbmd
  version 0.2 and earlier should consider recreating their dsbmd.conf from
  the new dsbmd.conf.sample.

20170518:
  AFFECTS: users of www/yarn
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  The default node backend for yarn has switched to www/node. Binary
  package users should expect the node backend to be switched during
  the upgrade. To keep the node6 (LTS) backend, rebuild www/yarn with
  the NODE6 backend option enabled.

20170517:
  AFFECTS: users of security/pecl-ssh2
  AUTHOR: dbaio@FreeBSD.org

  The security/pecl-ssh2 has been upgraded to version 1.0, and the new
  version is not compatible with PHP5. If you need PHP5 support, you can
  find version 0.13 in security/pecl-ssh2-0.

20170412:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/ansible
  AUTHOR: lifanov@FreeBSD.org

  The default value for ansible_python_interpreter has been changed
  to match the upstream /usr/bin/python. If managing FreeBSD systems,
  adjust the hosts database to explicitly set a valid python interpreter:

  [freebsd]
  host1

  [freebsd_vars]
  ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/local/bin/python2.7

20170411:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to the latest stable version 2.5 of LibreSSL.
  The shared library versions of the libraries have been bumped.

  After upgrading, manually update all packages that depend on any of the
  libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and libtls) since the
  versions of these libraries have changed. Normally, you can obtain the
  list of dependent software by running the following command:

  # pkg info -r libressl

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies. Poudriere and pkg handle this correctly,
  portmaster and portupgrade users can use the following to rebuild all
  dependent ports.

  Portmaster users:
      portmaster -r libressl
  Portupgrade users:
      portupgrade -fr security/libressl

20170411:
  AFFECTS: www/firefox
  AUTHOR: gecko@FreeBSD.org

  Firefox 53 or later may fail to build if sem(4) is present (see below)
  because sysconf(3) still consults the old limits. If you don't plan to
  run FreeBSD 8.x or older binaries make sure sem(4) isn't loaded during
  boot or built statically into the kernel.

20170410:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-wm/awesome
  AUTHOR: garga@FreeBSD.org

  Awesome Window Manager (x11-wm/awesome) was upgraded to 4.1 and its config
  is not backward compatible with 3.5.  A new port was created to keep 3.5
  version available at x11-wm/awesome3 and it will be available for 6 months
  until users have time to upgrade configuration.

  There are references about what has changed in 4.0 at:

  https://awesomewm.org/apidoc/documentation/89-NEWS.md.html#v4

  And configuration porting tips at:

  https://awesomewm.org/apidoc/documentation/17-porting-tips.md.html#v4

  If you would like to keep using 3.x, please run the collowing command to
  update pkg database:

  # pkg set -n awesome:awesome3
  # pkg set -o x11-wm/awesome:x11-wm/awesome3

20170404:
  AFFECTS: users of Xapian 1.2.x and www/ikiwiki
  AUTHOR: sunpoet@FreeBSD.org

  Xapian has been updated to 1.4.3. The 1.2.x series has been renamed with
  suffix "12". The Perl binding for Xapian 1.4.x is databases/p5-Xapian.
  Since www/ikiwiki depends on Search::Xapian, it stays with Xapian 1.2.
  If you would like to keep using 1.2, please run the following commands
  to update pkg database:

  xapian-core:
    # pkg set -n xapian-core:xapian-core12
    # pkg set -o databases/xapian-core:databases/xapian-core12

  p5-Search-Xapian:
    # pkg set -n p5-Search-Xapian:p5-Search-Xapian12
    # pkg set -o databases/p5-Search-Xapian:databases/p5-Search-Xapian12

  xapian-bindings:
    # pkg set -n xapian-bindings:xapian-bindings12
    # pkg set -o databases/xapian-bindings:databases/xapian-bindings12

  xapian-omega:
    # pkg set -n xapian-omega:xapian-omega12
    # pkg set -o databases/xapian-omega:databases/xapian-omega12

20170401:
  AFFECTS: net/samba44, net/samba45, net/samba46 and devel/p5-Parse-Pidl*
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  It turned out that arbitary versions of p5-Parse-Pidl may lead to the
  hard to explain crashes of the Samba server and utilities(in particular
  we suspect it was responsible for the troubles with the DC provisioning).

  So, from now on net/samba* ports use bundled version of Pidl. You need to
  remove external package from the system:

  pkg delete -f p5-Parse-Pidl p5-Parse-Pidl44

20170331:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openssh-portable
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  The format of several log messages emitted by the packet code has
  changed to include additional information about the user and
  their authentication state. Software that monitors ssh/sshd logs
  may need to account for these changes. For example:

  Connection closed by user x 1.1.1.1 port 1234 [preauth]
  Connection closed by authenticating user x 10.1.1.1 port 1234 [preauth]
  Connection closed by invalid user x 1.1.1.1 port 1234 [preauth]

  Affected messages include connection closure, timeout, remote
  disconnection, negotiation failure and some other fatal messages
  generated by the packet code.

20170326:
  AFFECTS: users of samba43
  AUTHOR: antoine@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of samba has been switched from 4.3 to 4.4.
  Upgrade instructions:

  For package users having samba43 installed indirectly (as a dependency):
    # pkg upgrade

  For package users having samba43 installed directly (leaf port):
    # pkg upgrade
    # pkg install samba44

  For ports users:
    If you want to keep samba43, add DEFAULT_VERSIONS+= samba=4.3 to make.conf

    If you want to upgrade to samba44, remove samba43 and obsolete packages:
    # pkg delete -f samba36-libsmbclient samba36-nmblookup samba36-smbclient samba36 samba43 p5-Parse-Pidl

    Portmaster users:
    # portmaster net/samba44
    # portmaster -a

    Portupgrade users:
    # portinstall net/samba44
    # portupgrade -a

20170325:
  AFFECTS: net/samba46 and devel/p5-Parse-Pidl
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  New version of Samba port from 4.6 branch is added. Before upgrading please read upgrade notes:

  https://www.samba.org/samba/history/samba-4.6.0.html

  For the vfs_fruit users:

  Users on *BSD must rename the metadata xattr used by vfs_fruit when
  using the default setting "fruit:metadata = netatalk".

  Due to a glitch in the Samba xattr API compatibility layer for FreeBSD and a
  mistake in vfs_fruit, vfs_fruit ended up using the wrong xattr name when
  configured with "fruit:metadata = netatalk" (default). Instead of the correct

  org.netatalk.Metadata

  it used

  netatalk.Metadata

  Starting with Samba 4.6 vfs_fruit will use the correct "org.netatalk.Metadata"
  which means existing installations must rename this xattrs. For this purpose
  Samba now includes a new tool `mvxattr`.

20170325:
  AFFECTS: net/samba45, net/samba46 and devel/p5-Parse-Pidl
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  While new Uses/samba.mk dosen't work well with slave ports to compile devel/p5-Parse-Pidl
  for net/samba45 or net/samba46 you need explicitly set in the /etc/make.conf:

  SAMBA4_PORT=net/samba46

  explicitly. In the future that shouldn't be necessary.

20170321:
  AFFECTS: users of samba36-libsmbclient, samba36-nmblookup samba36-smbclient and samba36
  AUTHOR: antoine@FreeBSD.org

  The obsolete samba36-libsmbclient, samba36-nmblookup, samba36-smbclient and samba36 packages/ports were removed
  and USES=samba was introduced.
  Upgrade instructions:

  For package users having those ports installed indirectly (as dependencies):
    # pkg upgrade

  For package users having those ports installed directly (leaf ports):
    # pkg upgrade
    # pkg install samba43

  For ports users:
    Choose you samba version, for instance add DEFAULT_VERSIONS+= samba=4.3 to make.conf

    Remove obsolete packages:
    # pkg delete -f samba36-libsmbclient samba36-nmblookup samba36-smbclient samba36

    Portmaster users:
    # portmaster net/samba43
    # portmaster -a

    Portupgrade users:
    # portinstall net/samba43
    # portupgrade -a

20170319:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/pecl-mailparse
  AUTHOR: dbaio@bsd.com.br

  The mail/pecl-mailparse has been upgraded to version 3.0.2, and the new
  version is not compatible with PHP5. If you need PHP5 support, you can
  find version 2.1.6 in mail/pecl-mailparse2.

20170319:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/pecl-yaml
  AUTHOR: dbaio@bsd.com.br

  The pecl-yaml has been upgraded to version 2.0.0, and the new version is
  not compatible with PHP5. If you need PHP5 support, you can find version
  1.3.0 in textproc/pecl-yaml1.

20170316:
  AFFECTS: users of python setuptools
  AUTHOR: antoine@FreeBSD.org

  The python setuptools ports have been renamed to better match other python ports.
  Ports users need to rename them so that portupgrade and portmaster do not
  get confused.  For example:

    pkg set -n py27-setuptools27:py27-setuptools
    pkg set -o devel/py-setuptools27:devel/py27-setuptools
  or
    pkg set -n py35-setuptools35:py35-setuptools
    pkg set -o devel/py-setuptools35:devel/py35-setuptools

20170312:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/ack
  AUTHOR: sunpoet@FreeBSD.org

  ack has been renamed back to p5-ack to match our perl naming. You could
  run the following to update pkg database:

    # pkg set -n ack:p5-ack
    # pkg set -o textproc/ack:textproc/p5-ack

20170311:
  AFFECTS: users of games/tome4 with paid DLCs
  AUTHOR: lifanov@FreeBSD.org

  The Ashes of Urh'Rok and Embers of Rage DLCs have been updated to be
  compatible with changes introduced in ToME 1.5.0. Users of these DLCs
  will need to redownload nd place these in $HOME/.t-engine/4.0/addons.

20170302:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/thunderbird with Lightning
  AUTHOR: cmt@FreeBSD.org

  After changes in the packaging of the Lightning extension, profiles
  using this extension have to be re-created.

20170223:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/mtbl
  AUTHOR: truckman@FreeBSD.org

  There is a libmtbl shared library version bump in mtbl version 1.0.0.
  The affected dependent ports have had PORTREVISION bumps, but you will
  need to rebuild any applications that link to libmtbl.

20170220:
  AFFECTS: sysutils/filebeat sysutils/metricbeat sysutils/packetbeat
  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  The three elasticsearch beats ports have merged into one single port
  systuils/beats that installs all of the above and some more. The reason is to
  make the port more maintainable and also that the new heartbeat beat would
  conflict with sysutils/heartbeat.

20170220:
  AFFECTS: devel/libevent2
  AUTHOR: jbeich@FreeBSD.org

  libevent2 has been renamed back to libevent as the default version.
  If you manage out of tree ports make sure to run the following:

    # pkg set -n libevent2:libevent
    # pkg set -o devel/libevent2:devel/libevent

20170218:
  AFFECTS: users of Qt 4 and Qt 5
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  Following what is already done in Qt 5, the Qt 4 ports no longer install
  their binaries into ${LOCALBASE}/bin (which is "/usr/local/bin" in most
  cases). Additionally, the "-qt4" suffix has been dropped from the file names
  of the binaries that had it, such as "qmake-qt4".

  The new misc/qtchooser port is now used to choose whether a Qt 4 or Qt 5
  version of a binary such as "moc", "qmake" or "designer" will be used. By
  default, the Qt 5 versions are preferred, but that can be changed by setting
  the QT_SELECT environment variable to "qt4".

  qtchooser also allows one to seamlessly use other Qt installations for those
  binaries, which is particularly beneficial to people working on Qt itself or
  who need their own checkouts.

  See qtchooser(1) for more information on how to configure qtchooser.

20170213:
  AFFECTS: users of www/node*
  AUTHOR: bradleythughes@fastmail.fm

  The BUNDLED_SSL option is now enabled by default on FreeBSD 10, since
  Node.js requires OpenSSL 1.0.2, and FreeBSD 10 is shipped with 1.0.1.

20170213:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/libGL, graphics/libEGL, graphics/libglesv2
  AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  The workaround for handling conflicting libraries between the
  nvidia-driver, libGL, libEGL and libglesv2 ports was removed. If the
  nvidia-driver port is updated before the other ports, it will remove
  the libraries of said ports. This is a side effect of how the workaround
  worked. If this happens reinstalling the affected port is enough.

  pkg users can run: pkg install -f libGL libEGL libglesv2

20170211:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-server/xorg-server
  AUTHOR: rezny@FreeBSD.org

  Xorg server has been updated to 1.18.4 and autodetection has changed.
  The order in which drivers are now attempted is:
    1) vendor/model specific driver according to PCI IDs
    2) generic modesetting driver which requires a drm driver with KMS
    3) scfb, the generic framebuffer driver
    4) vesa (only if arch is x86)

  This should minimize the need for xorg.conf files. It is recommended to
  load the correct KMS driver (i915kms.ko or radeonkms.ko) via rc.conf,
  i.e. kld_list="i915kms.ko", to ensure correct functionality. Although
  the vendor drivers may attempt to load the correct drm driver, which
  does not always work, the modesetting driver assumes the required KMS
  driver is already loaded and will fail if there is none. The modesetting
  driver is now recommended as an alternative to the Intel driver; the
  performance is comparable and stability is better with modesetting. The
  ATI driver continues to offer better performance than modesetting.

20170203:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl-devel
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The version 2.5.1 bumps the libcrypto, libssl and libtls shared library
  versions. You will have to rebuild all packages that depend on
  libressl-devel. Check the 20160811 libressl entry for more detailed
  guidance on rebuilding.

20170202:
  AFFECTS: users of www/uwsgi
  AUTHOR: feld@FreeBSD.org

  The previous disruptive changes to uwsgi for security have been remediated
  through creation of a dedicated uwsgi user/group and utilizing the
  uwsgi feature to set socket ownership. The uwsgi daemon by default now
  has the following properties:

  * Process runs as uwsgi user and group (UID/GID 165)
  * Socket mode is 660, still protecting unauthorized access from "other"
  * Socket ownership is www:www, restoring compatibility

20170130:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/ice, devel/py-ice, devel/php5-ice
  AUTHOR: grembo@FreeBSD.org

  Since __WORDSIZE as defined by <stdint.h> always reports 32 when using
  C++98/03 (unless __STDC_LIMIT_MACROS is set explictly), Ice 3.6.3 used
  "long long" for Int64 instead of "long" on 64-bit platforms by mistake.
  A workaround has been added in version 3.6.3_2 of these three ports,
  requiring to upgrade all of them at the same time and to rebuild all
  custom code that links against them.

20170129:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/motion
  AUTHOR: jhale@FreeBSD.org

  Version 3.x expected the configuration files to reside in:
	${LOCALBASE}/etc
  Version 4.x expects the configuration files to reside in:
	${LOCALBASE}/etc/motion
  This was unfortunately overlooked when the port was updated to 4.x, but it
  has now been fixed to install the default configuration file in the new
  location. The rc script now checks for motion.conf in the new location.

  While you may be able to simply copy your old motion.conf to the new location,
  it is recommended to review ${LOCALBASE}/etc/motion/motion.conf and make
  changes to it based on your old ${LOCALBASE}/etc/motion.conf as some options
  have been added and removed.

  Further, if you use motion with multiple cameras and have
  ${LOCALBASE}/etc/thread[0-9].conf files, they should be moved to
  ${LOCALBASE}/etc/motion as well. These files are deprecated and should be
  renamed to camera[0-9].conf and in motion.conf, lines like:
	thread /usr/local/etc/thread1.conf
  Should be converted to:
	camera /usr/local/etc/motion/camera1.conf

20170127:
  AFFECTS: users of www/uwsgi
  AUTHOR: feld@FreeBSD.org

  The default socket mode for uwsgi as 777 is a severe security concern.
  This has been remediated by changing the rc script to default to 600.
  The mode is configurable with rc.conf values: uwsgi_socket_mode="600"
  or for a profile named "www", uwsgi_www_socket_mode="600".

20170121:
  AFFECTS: users of security/tinc
  AUTHOR: dinoex@FreeBSD.org

  this version of tinc requires all nodes in the VPN to be linked with a
  version of OpenSSL or LibreSSL that supports the AES256 and SHA256
  algorithms.


20170120:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql56-server
  AUTHOR: feld@FreeBSD.org

  databases/mysql56-server was updated to 5.6.35 which included backported
  rc script changes from the mysql57-server port. This broke mysql_optfile in
  rc.conf and also forced a sample my.cnf if none existed. MySQL has
  some parameters which cannot be changed after a database has been
  created, so this caused MySQL to fail to start.

  This change was reverted in mysql56-server-5.6.35_1

  An additional change was made in mysql56-server-5.6.35_2 to prevent
  automatic loading of a sample my.cnf which was causing issues for

  AUTHOR: amdmi3@FreeBSD.org

  The ports system will now refuse to build anything if it's run on
  outdated system version. This protects users from unexpected build
  failures after code to support EoL'ed systems is removed from the
  tree. You may define ALLOW_UNSUPPORTED_SYSTEM to override this and
  allow builds, but no support will be provided in case of failures.

  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby22
  AUTHOR: swills@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 2.2 to 2.3.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 2.2 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 2.2 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ruby=2.2

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  software that uses ruby. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  upon how you manage your system.

  If you use pkgng, simply upgrade:
  # pkg upgrade

  If you use portmaster, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:
  # portmaster -o lang/ruby23 lang/ruby22
  # portmaster -R -r ruby-2.3

  If you use portupgrade, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:

  # pkg delete -f ruby portupgrade
  # make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portupgrade install clean
  # pkg set -o lang/ruby22:lang/ruby23
  # portupgrade -x ruby-2.3.\* -fr lang/ruby23

  AUTHOR: Colin Booth <colin-ports@heliocat.net>

  skalibs has undergone a major version bump and compatibility is not
  guaranteed for software with a runtime dependency on
  libskarnet.so.2.3.9.0. This will not affect lang/execline or
  sysutils/s6 as those are statically linked against libskarnet.a.

  execline has undergone a major version bump and compatibility is not
  guaranteed for software with a runtime dependency on
  libexecline.so.2.1.4.5. This will not affect sysutils/s6 as all s6
  programs are statically linked against libexecline.a.

  s6 has undergone a major version bump and compatibility is not
  guaranteed for software with a runtime dependency on
  libs6.so.2.2.4.3. Additionally, s6-applyuidgid and s6-setuidgid

  v6.x LTS branch. Users wanting to stay on v6.x can replace www/node
  with www/node6 with one of the following commands:

  # pkg set -o www/node:www/node6

  AUTHOR: jhale@FreeBSD.org

  Gpgme has been updated to 1.8.0.
  With it comes the removal of libgpgme-pthread.so in favor of using
  libgpgme.so itself as the thread-safe library. Ports that may have
  linked to -lgpgme-pthread will now just link to -lgpgme. PORTREVISION
  has been bumped on all ports with a dependency on security/gpgme.

  The Python module provided by security/py-gpgme has been renamed
  from pyme3 to gpg, as well.

  Portmaster users:

20161116:
  AFFECTS: Users of sysutils/bareos-*
  AUTHOR: rand@iteris.com

  Bareos v1.6.x changed the configuration scheme, from one configuration
  file per Bareos component (file daemon, storage daemon, and director)
  to several configuration files, in several directories, for each
  component. See http://doc.bareos.org/master/html/bareos-manual-main-reference.html

  The new scheme will use all files named *.conf in the directory
  hierarchies for each component:

    /usr/local/etc/bareos/bareos-dir.d/
    /usr/local/etc/bareos/bareos-fd.d/
    /usr/local/etc/bareos/bareos-sd.d/

  To retain the old configuration scheme of one file per component add
  appropriate lines such as these to your /etc/rc.conf:

    bareos_dir_config="/usr/local/etc/bareos/bareos-dir.conf"
    bareos_fd_config="/usr/local/etc/bareos/bareos-fd.conf"
    bareos_sd_config="/usr/local/etc/bareos/bareos-sd.conf"

20161113:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/libosinfo
  AUTHOR: novel@FreeBSD.org

  The libosinfo port was separated into three different ports
  to follow the upstream split:

   - sysutils/osinfo-db-tools: contains the CLI tools
   - misc/osinfo-db: contains database with OS data
   - devel/libosinfo: the library

  As osinfo-db-tools now ships binaries that previously were
  part of libosinfo, it's required to delete the old libosinfo
  package to prevent conflict because of same files installation:

  # pkg delete libosinfo

  And then install the new version.

20161112:
  AFFECTS: users of security/heimdal
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  Heimdal in the base system and security/heimdal <= 1.5.3_6 use
  Berkeley DB to store principals into /var/heimdal/heimdal.db and
  the database format is version 3 by default.  On the other hand,
  security/heimdal 1.5.3_7 or newer use the newer version of
  Berkeley DB and the database format is version 9.
  These two versions are not compatible with each other.  If there is
  a mismatch between Heimdal utilities and its database format,
  you will get an error like the following:

  # /usr/local/sbin/kadmin -l dump
  BDB0641 __db_meta_setup: /var/heimdal/heimdal.db: unexpected file type or format
  kadmin: hdb_open: opening /var/heimdal/heimdal: Invalid argument

  This mismatch can occur in the following three cases:

  1. You used Heimdal in the base system and switch to use security/heimdal
     after creating /var/db/heimdal.db.

  2. You used security/heimdal >= 1.5.3_7 and switch to use one in the
     base system.

  3. You used security/heimdal < 1.5.3_7 and upgrade it to 1.5.3_7 or later.

  To fix this mismatch, you need to dump contents of heimdal.db and
  rebuild the database by using kadmin(8) utility.

  If you use Heimdal in the base system or older versions of
  security/heimdal, and plan to switch to use
  security/heimdal >= 1.5.3_7, execute the following command
  *after* creating a backup copy of /var/heimdal and installing
  security/heimdal:

  # /usr/bin/kadmin -l dump /var/heimdal/heimdal.db.dump
  # rm /var/heimdal/heimdal.db
  # /usr/local/sbin/kadmin -l load /var/heimdal/heimdal.db.dump
  # rm /var/heimdal/heimdal.db.dump

  The above example assumes security/heimdal is installed into
  /usr/local.  If your base system is compiled with WITHOUT_KERBEROS
  use the following instead:

  # db_dump185-5 /var/heimdal/heimdal.db | db_load-5 /var/heimdal/heimdal.db.new
  # chown 0600 /var/heimdal/heimdal.db.new
  # mv /var/heimdal/heimdal.db.new /var/heimdal/heimdal.db

  db_dump and db_load utilitites are installed by database/db5 as
  dependency of security/heimdal.

  If you want to switch from security/heimdal to Heimdal in the base
  system, use the following:

  # /usr/local/sbin/kadmin -l dump /var/heimdal/heimdal.db.dump
  # rm /var/heimdal/heimdal.db
  # /usr/bin/kadmin -l load /var/heimdal/heimdal.db.dump
  # rm /var/heimdal/heimdal.db.dump

20161105:

  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  kadmin(8) in heimdal-1.5.3_5 and prior did not create a database

  upgrade will do the right thing.  For the other people, assuming you are
  migrating from 5.20 to 5.24, do:

  First, add to /etc/make.conf:

  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=  perl5=5.24

  Portupgrade users:
	portupgrade -o lang/perl5.24 -f lang/perl5.20

	  You can now remove the DEFAULT_VERSIONS line added earlier
	  from /etc/make.conf

	  Then you will need to rebuild everything that uses libperl.so, you

	portupgrade -f `pkg shlib -qR libperl.so.5.20`

  Portmaster users:
	portmaster -o lang/perl5.24 lang/perl5.20

	  You can now remove the DEFAULT_VERSIONS line added earlier

  The default unix user used by the PostgreSQL daemon has changed to
  `postgres' to reflect the long time upstream's convention. Any scripts
  you have using the old `pgsql' unix user should be modified when upgrading to
  PostgreSQL version 9.6. Older versions of PostgreSQL will continue using
  `pgsql' until their end-of-life.

  For users with UTF-8 locales in the database: The ICU patch is *activated by
  default* for the PostgreSQL-9.6 server. For previous versions it was optional
  and default off, but this has changed. Please read the entry here below from
  20160811 and understand the consequences of changing between ICU and system
  locale for database collation (short version: don't). pg_upgrade requires the
  collation method to be the same (or a reindex), while pg_dump/restore does not.

  Also, the default home directory for the postgres user is now
  /var/db/postgres, and the default data directory for PostgreSQL 9.6 is
  /var/db/postgres/data96.

20160829:
  AFFECTS: users of security/sshguard
  AUTHOR: feld@FreeBSD.org

  Sshguard has been updated to 1.7.0. There have been several changes to
  this release. Notably the hosts and ipfilter backends are no longer
  supported. If you need these backends to be supported and you missed
  the survey sent out by upstream I urge you to contact upstream.

  The hosts backend was previously served by security/sshguard directly.
  The additional backends were slave ports with package name suffixes. I
  have opted to keep the master/slave port relationship but not choose a
  specific backend for security/sshguard. Instead it is now a metaport
  which will prompt you for which backend you prefer. If no backend is
  configured it will depend on security/sshguard-ipfw, which is the
  native FreeBSD firewall. This my be surprising to users who depended
  on security/sshguard which only provided hosts/TCP Wrappers blocking,
  but there is no replacement at this time.

  I would also like to document that sshguard no longer accepts the -e
  argument which allowed external scripts to run when sshguard finds a
  match. As a result the null backend can no longer be used to create
  custom blocking functionality; it only serves as a detection backend.

  If the removed backends return due to user demand they will be added
  as slave ports for consistency. I apologize for any inconvenience and
  lack of notice on the deprecation of these features.

  and ensure that '/usr/local/etc/rspamd/module.d/fuzzy_check.conf` has
  the line `algorithm = "mumhash";` for the "rspamd.com" rule. The more
  detailed information could be found on
  https://rspamd.com/announce/2016/08/15/rspamd-1.3.3.html

  AFFECTS: users of dns/powerdns*
  AUTHOR: junovitch@FreeBSD.org

  PowerDNS Authoritative Server and Recursor 4.0.0+ introduce significant
  changes to the configuration files, which need to be handled before
  restarting the services. As from the Recursor changelog, "The Lua hook
  infrastructure was redone using LuaWrapper; old scripts will no longer
  work, but new scripts are easier to write under the new interface."

  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to the latest stable version 2.4 of LibreSSL.
  The shared library versions of the libraries have been bumped.
  With this update, the patch for the OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER has been
  removed. This causes issues with a number of ports. Patches for all
  ports for which this issues is known can be found on
  https://wiki.freebsd.org/LibreSSL/Ports#OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER

  After upgrading, manually update all packages that depend on any of the
  libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and libtls) since the
  versions of these libraries have changed. Normally, you can obtain the
  list of dependent software by running the following command:

  # pkg info -r libressl

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies. Poudriere and pkg handle this correctly,
  portmaster and portupgrade users can use the following to rebuild all
  dependent ports.

  Portmaster users:
      portmaster -r libressl
  Portupgrade users:
      portupgrade -fr security/libressl

  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresqlNN-server with ICU patch
  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  The ICU patch is added to the PostgreSQL-9.5 server. Please note that you
  must never change between using the ICU patch and using system locale for
  the same database cluster without REINDEXing all TEXT/VARCHAR columns, or
  dump and restore your database. Failing to do so will result in corrupted
  indexes due to the differences between the locale definitions. ICU will
  always be the better choice for speed and correctness.

  Also, the ICU patch used to support other Unicode encodings than UTF-8,
  but that has been removed due to lack of demand and the complicated testing
  required. If you use another Unicode encoding and rely on ICU for collation,
  please refrain from upgrading the postgresql server and instead contact the
  author named above.

  AFFECTS: users of emulators/virtualbox-ose
  AUTHOR: jkim@FreeBSD.org

  VirtualBox has been updated to 5.0.26 and it is incompatible with old
  kernel modules.  You should upgrade emulators/virtualbox-ose-kmod and
  load new kernel modules before starting new version, e.g.,

  # service vboxnet restart

  AFFECTS: users of games/stonesoup-*
  AUTHOR: lifanov@mail.lifanov.com

  The WIZARD option has been renamed to NOWIZARD and is now an opt-out to
  better reflect the upstream. If you run a shared game server and would
  like the Wizard mode support disabled, please update port options.

20160718:
  AFFECTS: users of www/awstats
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  The directory containing icons has changed from ".../icons" to ".../icon".
  awstats has, in its suggested configuration file, contained an alias
  from /awstatsicons. After applying the awstats-7.5 update, you must
  update that alias to point to /usr/local/www/awstats/icon (just remove
  the "s" at the end).

20160708:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/screen
  AUTHOR: cy@FreeBSD.org

  GNU Screen was updated to version 4.4.0 (r417201).  Note that there was
  fix to screen message structure field responsible for $TERM handling,
  making it impossible to attach to older versions.

20160704:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql57-*
  AUTHOR: riggs@FreeBSD.org

  The default location for my.cnf has changed from "/var/db/mysql/my.cnf"
  to "/usr/local/etc/mysql/my.cnf". Existing my.cnf files must be merged
  manually with the new default and moved to the new location. To
  continue using the my.cnf file at the old location, set "mysql_optfile"
  in /etc/rc.conf to point to the location of the existing my.cnf file.
