This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when upgrading
your ports.  We try our best to minimize these disruptions, but sometimes
they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each time
you update your ports collection, before attempting any port upgrades.

  AFFECTS: users of www/gitea
  AUTHOR: stb@lassitu.de

  Gitea requires the addition of another secret to the config file in order to
  start up.  Either manually add JWT_SECRET to the
  ${PREFIX}/etc/gitea/conf/app.ini config file (see app.ini.sample), or allow
  Gitea to make the change for you by making the config file writable to the
  git user.

  AFFECTS: users of www/node
  AUTHOR: bhughes@FreeBSD.org

  The www/node port has been udpated to Node.js v12.0.0, the latest
  upstream release. This is a major release, including many significant
  changes. Users are encouraged to read the release announcements before
  upgrading:

  https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v12.0.0/

20190423:
  AFFECTS: users of www/gitlab-ce
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  The directory where all repositories and ssh permissions are stored
  was changed from /usr/home/git back to /usr/local/git, to match again the
  recommended standards on FreeBSD.
  This will cause now some other git management packages to collide with
  gitlab. Make sure you migrate all you git repositories to gitlab first,
  before you continue.

  Make sure /usr/local/git/repositories and /usr/local/git/.ssh are not
  existing!
  Otherwise the next commands can break your installation for managing
  git repositories within gitlab and with your other gitlab management
  software!

  You must move the old files to the new location with:
  # service gitlab stop
  # mv /usr/home/git /usr/local/
  # pkg upg

  Make sure you update your config files, diff shows you what you maybe
  must change:
  # cd /usr/local/www/gitlab-ce
  # git diff config/gitlab.yml.sample config/gitlab.yml
  # cd /usr/local/share/gitlab-shell/
  # git diff config.yml.sample config.yml
  # cd /usr/local/share/gitaly
  # git diff config.toml.sample config.toml

  # Change home directory of user git back to /usr/local/git
  # vipw
  The line should now looks like:
  git:*:211:211::0:0:gitosis user:/usr/local/git:/bin/sh

  If you do an upgrade of gitlab follow the upgrade guide.
  If not, just start gitlab again with:
  # service gitlab start

20190422:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to the latest stable version 2.9 of LibreSSL.
  The shared library versions of the libraries have been bumped.

  After upgrading, manually update all packages that depend on any of the
  libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and libtls) since the
  versions of these libraries have changed. Normally, you can obtain the
  list of dependent software by running the following command:

  # pkg info -r libressl

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies. Poudriere and pkg handle this correctly,
  portmaster and portupgrade users can use the following to rebuild all
  dependent ports.

  Portmaster users:
      portmaster -r libressl
  Portupgrade users:
      portupgrade -fr security/libressl

20190421:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/cego
  AUTHOR: pi@FreeBSD.org

  To upgrade from cego 2.39.16 to 2.44.1, you need to export to xml before
  the upgrade and import from xml after the upgrade, because the internal
  storage has changed for some types.

  Use these steps:

  - export your database while it runs, see
    http://www.lemke-it.com/litexec?request=pubcegodoc&user=&lang=en&section=cgdoc_database_running.html#tsimpexp_mode
    for details.
  - stop the database
    service cego stop
  - upgrade the port/package
  - re-create the database
    cego --mode=create --tableset=<database> --dbxml=<database>.xml
  - import the database
    cego --mode=xmlimport --tableset=<database> \
	--dbxml=<database>.xml --impfile=export.xml --doLogging
  - modify /etc/rc.conf by adding
    cego_<database>_cpdump="YES"
    cego_<database>_cleanup="YES"
  - start the database
    service cego start

20190420:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby24
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 2.4 to 2.5.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 2.4 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 2.4 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ruby=2.4

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  software that uses ruby. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  upon how you manage your system.

  If you use pkgng, simply upgrade:
  # pkg upgrade

  If you use portmaster, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:
  # portmaster -o lang/ruby25 lang/ruby24
  # portmaster -R -r ruby-2.5

  If you use portupgrade, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:

  # pkg delete -f ruby portupgrade
  # make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portupgrade install clean
  # pkg set -o lang/ruby24:lang/ruby25
  # portupgrade -x ruby-2.5.\* -fr lang/ruby25

20190419:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/qemu
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  qemu 2.X version has been moved to qemu2. If you would like to use
  2.X you should use qemu2. Otherwise you can use the new stable 
  upstream branch of 3.0.X.

  Portmaster users will need to run this command:

  portmaster -o emulators/qemu2 emulators/qemu

20190410:
  AFFECTS: users of python
  AUTHOR: antoine@FreeBSD.org

  Default version of python was switched to 3.6.

  For ports users wanting to keep version 2.7 as default,
  add DEFAULT_VERSIONS+= python=2.7 to make.conf

20190328:
  AFFECTS: www/firefox-i18n, www/firefox-esr-i18n, mail/thunderbird-i18n, www/seamonkey-i18n
  AUTHOR: gecko@FreeBSD.org

  Separate packages for localization packs are no longer supported.
  Firefox 65+ has in-browser menu while Firefox ESR60, Thunderbird 60
  or SeaMonkey 2.49 should download preferred .xpi manually. Refer to
  the following article (including previous revisions) how to do this.

20190328:
  AFFECTS: users of www/qt5-webengine
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  Users that upgrade www/qt5-webengine without using pkg/poudriere might
  experience failures due to conflicts with the installed version of 5.9.5.

  In that case, pkg delete -f the qt5-webengine package before building
  the updated version.

20190314:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/rspamd, mail/rspamd-devel
  AUTHOR: vsevolod@FreeBSD.org

  User and group that rspamd run as are changed from nobody:nobody to
  rspamd:rspamd. Unless it is clean install you need to execute following
  command.

  # chown -R rspamd:rspamd /var/db/rspamd /var/log/rspamd /var/run/rspamd

20190311:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/xorg, x11-fonts/mkfontscale, x11-fonts/mkfontdir
  AUTHOR: zeising@FreeBSD.org

  The x11-fonts/mkfontdir port has been removed and the functionality
  has been merged into x11-fonts/mkfontscale.  This might cause issues
  with upgrading.  If you get conflicts between mkfontscale and mkfontdir
  please remove mkfontdir before upgrading.

  To do this, simply run the following:
      pkg delete -f mkfontdir

20190311:
  AFFECTS: users of www/igal2
  AUTHOR: rodrigo@freebsd.org

  www/igal2 2.2-1 is now built with graphics/ImageMagick6-nox11
  and don't install the ImageMagik X11 dependencies anymore.
  A build option allows you to restore the previous behaviour.

20190303:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-fonts/noto*
  AUTHOR: sunpoet@FreeBSD.org

  Google Noto Fonts family has been converted to several ports. x11-fonts/noto
  is a meta port which includes 1 old port and 5 new ports as follows:
  - x11-fonts/noto-basic (was noto-lite): basic fonts set with emoji
  - x11-fonts/noto-extra: extra fonts set
  - x11-fonts/noto-jp: Japanese fonts set
  - x11-fonts/noto-kr: Korean fonts set
  - x11-fonts/noto-sc: Simplified Chinese fonts set

  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/paladin
  AUTHOR: Ryan Westlund <rlwestlund@gmail.com>

  The way paladin parses its config file has changed, please
  check the provided sample config.

20190227:
  AFFECTS: users of security/softether, security/softether-devel
  AUTHOR: meta@FreeBSD.org

  These ports' bridge, client, server daemon unintendedly had spit out
  chain_certs (certificate chain) directory on libexec directory until
  r494024.

  If your ${PREFIX}/libexec/softether/chain_certs directory is empty, you
  can remove the directory safely. If the directory is not empty, move it
  to ${SE_DBDIR} when upgrading softether. Following commands should help:

      service softether_(bridge|cleint|server) stop
      (portmaster, portupgrade or pkg upgrade)
      mv ${PREFIX}/libexec/softether/chain_certs ${SE_DBDIR}/
      service softether_(bridge|cleint|server) start

  With the default Makefile settings, ${SE_DBDIR} is set to /var/db/softether.

20190224:
  AFFECTS: users of security/gnutls
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  GnuTLS now looks for its configuration files in PREFIX/etc (/usr/local/etc)
  instead of /etc.  If the following files exist they have to be moved.  On a
  default installation these files do not exist.

  /etc/gnutls/default-priorities
  /etc/gnutls/pkcs11.conf
  /etc/tpasswd
  /etc/tpasswd.conf

20190215:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/ejabberd
  AUTHOR: ashish@FreeBSD.org

  If you've mod_mam enabled with compress_xml set to true, then you're affected
  by bug where the XML namespace, and tag elements get interchanged in the MAM cache
  which results in invalid XML, and causing XMPP clients to disconnect. For more details,
  please refer to: https://github.com/processone/ejabberd/issues/2744

  This upgrade contains the patch that fixes the problem going forward. For fixing already
  affected users, you'll need to wipe off the MAM cache for the affected users:

      sudo -u ejabberd -H ejabberdctl remove_mam_for_user <user> <server>

20190207:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/mk-livestatus
  AUTHOR: egypcio@FreeBSD.org

  The default Nagios version supported by net-mgmt/mk-livestatus changed
  from Nagios 3 to Nagios 4 - the respective Nagios package was added to
  net-mgmt/mk-livestatus' runtime dependencies.

  If you still need support for Nagios 3 you just need to change the
  options for net-mgmt/mk-livestatus and compile the port yourself.

20190202:
  AFFECTS: users of archivers/urbackup-server
  AUTHOR: freebsd@coombscloud.com

  Some of the port's sources previously included absolute references to /etc/urbackup.  
  The upgrade now changes these references to ${PREFIX}/etc/urbackup. If you have placed 
  any configuration files within /etc/urbackup, these should be relocated to 
  ${PREFIX}/etc/urbackup.

20190130:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/password-store
  AUTHOR: rene@FreeBSD.org

  password-store now stores plugins in ${PREFIX}/libexec instead of ${PREFIX}/lib.
  Ensure to move your own extensions there too and update your scripts to avoid
  breakage.

20190124:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/rubygem-fluentd, sysutils/fluent-bit
  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  The fluentd port has been upgraded from the 0.12 line to 1.3.3.  The upgrade
  is mostly non-disruptive since there is a backward compatibility with 0.12
  plugins and configuration files, but care should be taken about the order of
  server upgrades since fluentd 1.x is unable to send it's data to version 0.12
  instances.  You should carefully read
  https://docs.fluentd.org/v1.0/articles/update-from-v0.12 before performing
  any upgrade activities.

20190120:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/fetchmail
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  The fetchmail port no longer offers the X11 option and no longer
  depends on Python.  The corresponding fetchmailconf Python program has now
  been split out into a separate port or package, so that fetchmail itself
  will no longer require Python.

  Users who wish to use fetchmailconf should install the new fetchmailconf
  port or package.

20190119:
  AFFECTS: users of german/webalizer2, japanese/webalizer, polish/webalizer2, portuguese/webalizer-pt_BR, portuguese/webalizer-pt_PT, ukrainian/webalizer, www/geolizer, www/webalizer

  or set the GeoIPDatabase option to the location of the file.

20190114:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/qgis
  AUTHOR: rhurlin@gwdg.de

  GIS 3.4 LTR, the first long-term release (LTR) of QGIS 3, has landed
  in the FreeBSD ports tree. It will also replace the previous 2.18 LTR
  in the QGIS package repositories in February 2019 [1].

  Beside, the latest Qt4 version 4.8.7 has been EOL since December 2015
  and its expiration date on FreeBSD is set to March, 15th 2019.
  Because QGIS 2 is based on Qt4 and Python2, it was decided to not create
  a legacy port for QGIS 2, after graphics/qgis changed to QGIS 3.

  For users moving over from the 2.18 LTR there is a huge list of new
  features and impactful changes in this new 3.4 LTR version. Most notably
  3.x plugins are incompatible with 2.x plugins, so please review your
  plugin usage carefully. Before moving over, if you have not already
  done so, take a look at the changelogs from versions 3.0, 3.2, and
  3.4 [2][3][4] to understand the full scope of changes in the 3.x release.

  AFFECTS: x11-wm/sway
  AUTHOR: jbeich@FreeBSD.org

  swayidle and swaylock split out into x11/swayidle and x11/swaylock.
  Check your sway config and install those if required.

20190113:
  AFFECTS: users of net/GeoIP
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  Maxmind no longer provides geolocation data in the legacy format used
  by net/GeoIP. All GEOIP-related OPTIONS have been removed, and all
  GeoIP-dependent ports will be removed soon.

  Where possible, you must switch to net/libmaxminddb, which uses the
  newer (and fully supported) GeoIP 2 format. Unfortunately, this is
  not a drop-in replacement. To fetch the GeoIP 2 geolocation databases,
  whether the free or paid versions, you must use net/geoipupdate
  (pkg install geoipupdate).

  The legacy database is no longer available, and we cannot distribute
  it by the Maxmind license, so the legacy GeoIP format is essentially
  dead.

20190108:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql-connector-java
  AUTHOR: matthew@FreeBSD.org

  The databases/mysql-connector-java port has been updated to 8.0.13,
  which requires a minimum of Java 1.8, so dropping support for Java
  1.6 and 1.7.  Users of those versions of Java should substitute the
  databases/mysql-connector-java51 port which remains at version
  5.1.47

20190103:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/vlc*
  AUTHOR: riggs@FreeBSD.org

  The multimedia/vlc port has been upgraded to 3.0.5, the latest upstream
  release. Subsequently, multimedia/vlc-qt4 and multimedia/vlc3 have been
  retired and removed from the ports tree. Users who previously used
  multimedia/vlc3 might want to switch to multimedia/vlc with the following
  commands:

  # pkg install multimedia/vlc
    or
  # portmaster -o multimedia/vlc multimedia/vlc3
    or
  # portupgrade -o multimedia/vlc multimedia/vlc3

20190102:
  AFFECTS: users of net/serviio
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  If you have customized your etc/serviio/profile.xml you need to review
  and merge changes from the profile.xml.sample file, else you may not be
  able to watch mkv files.

20181228:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/trio
  AUTHOR: rodrigo@freebsd.org

  Since trio 1.16-1, the shared lib previously misnamed libtrio.so.2.0.0
  is now named libtrio.so.2 and the symlink libtrio.so is created.

20181222:
  AFFECTS: users of net/ntopng
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Since ntopng 3.7, for security reasons, the default setting for
  the data directory has been changed to "/var/db/ntopng", and the
  default user has been changed to "ntopng". This new directory is
  created automatically by the port/package with correct permissions.

  In order to maintain backward compatibility, if you are already
  using "/var/tmp/ntopng" as data directory, ntopng keeps using that
  folder, owned by "nobody". This said, using the old defaults is not
  recommended and a manual action is required in order to migrate to
  the new settings, unless you are already using a custom directory:

  # service ntopng stop
  # mv /var/tmp/ntopng/* /var/db/ntopng/
  # chown -R ntopng:ntopng /var/db/ntopng
  # service ntopng start

  Please check hte upstream FAQ for reference:

  and run
       %%PREFIX%%/libexec/openhab2/runtime/bin/update.freebsd

  Config specific info (changes from 2.3.0 to 2.4.0):
  Astro Binding: The 'kilometer' and 'miles' channels have been replaced
                 by a new 'distance' channel
  Jeelink Binding: The 'currentWatt' and 'maxWatt' channels have been
                   replaced with 'currentPower' and 'maxPower' channels
  WeatherUnderground Binding: A bridge has been added on top of the

                              containing your api-key.
  ZWave Binding: Major changes have been merged to support features
                 such as security. All things must be deleted and
                 re-added. Refer to
                 https://community.openhab.org/t/zwave-binding-updates/51080
                 for further information.
  Synop Binding is now using UoM. 'wind-speed-ms' and 'wind-speed-knots'
                channels have been replaced by a single 'wind-speed'
                channel.
  Amazonechocontrol Binding: The account thing does not have settings
                             anymore. You have to login at amazon
                             once again through the proxy server
                             http(s)://<YourOpenHAB>/amazonechocontrol
  Milight Binding: The various available bulb types do not appear in
                   the Paper UI Inbox anymore. The correct bulb need
                   to be added manually. The bulb "zone" is now a
                   configuration. Bulb Things need to be recreated
                   to apply this change.
  Hue emulation: The item to hue ID mapping is no longer stored in
                 files, but in the openHAB storage service. You need
                 to rediscover "devices" in all services that use the
                 hue emulation (Amazon Echo, Google Home, etc).

20181215:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/graylog
  AUTHOR: dch@FreeBSD.org

  The dependent ports for ElasticSearch and MongoDB have both changed,

  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The default Perl version has been switched to Perl 5.28.  If you are using
  binary packages to upgrade your system, you do not have anything to do, pkg
  upgrade will do the right thing.  For the other people, follow the
  instructions in entry 20161103, it should still be the same.

20181212:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/ejabberd

20181211:
  AFFECTS: users of news/inn when upgrading to FreeBSD 12
  AUTHOR: naddy@FreeBSD.org

  When upgrading from FreeBSD 11 to 12, a change in the size of the
  ino_t type causes a binary incompatibility in the overview database
  if the default tradindexed format is used.

  After upgrading the inn package, remove the overview/group.index
  file and regenerate the history and overview database with
  makehistory(8) before starting innd.

  # echo '. /usr/local/news/lib/innshellvars && \

  In order to facilitate future porting efforts and help in supporting multiple
  FreeBSD versions, the DRM ports other than drm-kmod (graphics/drm-stable-kmod,
  graphics/drm-next-kmod, graphics/drm-devel-kmod) have been renamed to
  include the FreeBSD version they are designed for.

  drm-stable-kmod is drm-fbsd11.2-kmod
  drm-next-kmod is drm-fbsd12.0-kmod
  drm-devel-kmod is drm-current-kmod

20181209
  AFFECTS: users of devel/geany and devel/geany-plugins
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Geany and its plugins port have been moved to gtk3 and a new gtk2
  flavor has been added. The gtk2 flavor has a -gtk2 suffix added to the
  package name.

  If you want to stay with the gtk2 version you need to use "pkg install"
  to install the new gtk2 flavor, pkg will automatically deinstall the
  gtk3 flavors.

  If using port, to maintain the gtk2 version, you will need to deinstall
  geany and its plugins and reinstall specifying the gtk2 flavor.

  Note that the following plugins are not available if using the new
  gtk3 flavor:

  * geany-plugin-debugger
  * geany-plugin-devhelp
  * geany-plugin-geanypy
  * geany-plugin-multiterm
  * geany-plugin-scope

  Config specific info (changes from 2.2.0 to 2.3.0):
  Nest Binding: The 'camera' Thing Type now has channel groups.
                Add 'camera#' before the channel ID in the channel UID of
                existing camera channels. The 'time_to_target_mins' channel
                of the 'thermostat' Thing Type is renamed to 'time_to_target'
  Oceanic Binding: The 'softener' Thing Type no longer exists and is replaced
                   by the 'serial' and 'ethernet' Thing Types
  Yamaha Receiver Binding: The configuration parameter names now use lower
                           camel case convention. Change 'HOST' to 'host',
                           'PORT' to 'port' etc

  The newsyslog.conf(5) filename installed by the port has been changed:
  OLD: ${PREFIX}/etc/newsyslog.conf.d/${PORTNAME}
  NEW: ${PREFIX}/etc/newsyslog.conf.d/${PORTNAME}.conf

  Any file found at the old location will be automatically moved to the new

  Wayland support has been enabled in ports where it doesn't exclude
  X11 support in order to make the binary packages usable with Wayland
  compositors. If you get strange build failures re-run "make config"
  to pick up the new defaults. If the extra dependencies are not
  desired add the following to make.conf:

  AFFECTS: users of www/node
  AUTHOR: bhughes@FreeBSD.org

  The www/node port has been updated to Node.js v11.0.0, the latest
  upstream release. A new port, www/node10, has been created for the
  v10.x LTS branch. Users wanting to stay on v10.x can replace www/node
  with www/node8 with one of the following commands:

  # pkg install www/node10
    or
  # portmaster -o www/node10 www/node

  AFFECTS: users of lang/php71
  AUTHOR: joneum@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of PHP has been switched from 7.1 to 7.2.

  If you use binary packages you should make a list of php packages
  before running 'pkg upgrade':

  # pkg info php7\* > ~/installed-php-ports-list

  After the upgrade, check with such list if all your php extensions
  are still installed, and reinstall them if needed.

  If you use mod_php71 you need to deinstall it and install mod_php72.

20181020:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to the latest stable version 2.8 of LibreSSL.
  The shared library versions of the libraries have been bumped.

  After upgrading, manually update all packages that depend on any of the
  libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and libtls) since the
  versions of these libraries have changed. Normally, you can obtain the
  list of dependent software by running the following command:

  # pkg info -r libressl

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies. Poudriere and pkg handle this correctly,
  portmaster and portupgrade users can use the following to rebuild all
  dependent ports.

  Portmaster users:
      portmaster -r libressl
  Portupgrade users:
      portupgrade -fr security/libressl

  AFFECTS: users of mail/courier-imap and other courier ports
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Courier-IMAP 5.0.0 added IMAP UTF8 support, and converted maildir
  folders' names to Unicode.

  Updating an existing system to Courier-IMAP 5.0, and later,
  requires a manual one-time conversion of all existing maildirs
  using the maildirmake command. See the maildirmake(1) manual page
  for more information.

  All other courier ports accessing maildirs also need to be updated
  at the same time.

  HTTPS support has been removed from the port, as it will be removed upstream:
    https://github.com/Libresonic/libresonic/issues/125#issuecomment-256227104

  In order to avoid strange behavior for users who are using this feature, the
  rc.d script will fail fast if libresonic_ssl="YES". You should remove the
  following variables from rc.conf(5): libresonic_ssl libresonic_ssl_keystore
  libresonic_ssl_password.

  # sed -i '' /libresonic_ssl/d /etc/rc.conf

  Users needing SSL are encouraged to use an HTTP reverse-proxy. Example
  configurations can be found here:

  AFFECTS: users of graphics/ilmbase, graphics/OpenEXR
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  The IlmBase package has been updated to 2.3.0.
  The OpenEXR package has been renamed to openexr and updated to 2.3.0.

  The PORTREVISION of all ports requiring either has been bumped to
  ease the reubuilds, and where there were versions in the file names,
  these have been removed from the *_DEPENDS lines for easier maintenance.

  A full ports or package upgrade should just work.

  If you are doing partial updates, be sure to rebuild and reinstall
  all packages that require either of OpenEXR or ilmbase.
  Normally, these can be listed by running:

  # pkg info -q -r OpenEXR ilmbase  | sort -u | xargs pkg info -q -o

  # pkg info php5\* > ~/installed-php-ports-list

  After the upgrade, check with such list if all your php extensions
  are still installed, and reinstall them if needed.

  If you use mod_php56 you need to deinstall it and install mod_php71.

  AFFECTS: net/samba48
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  Samba ports from now on are not dependent from the databases/ldb* ports,
  as the link between Samba and LDB is too tight and each next major Samba
  release requires it's own major LDB release. Please, remove installed
  version of databases/ldb13 from your system with:

  # pkg delete -f databases/ldb13

  AFFECTS: net-mgmt/librenms
  AUTHOR: dvl@FreeBSD.org

  As of version 1.42, to conform with man hier, logs and rrd files have
  relocated outside the WWW directory. When upgrading from < 1.42 to more
  recent versions, the following steps are required.

  You must update config.php and manually relocate the rrd and log files.
  Before upgrading, please stop librenms,  update the configuration, and
  relocate the files.

  If you find graphs are not updating, fping >= 4.0 requires an IPv6
  address. Adding an IPv6 address should fix graphing.

  Please add these entries to config.php:

  $config['installed_from_package'] = true;
  $config['log_dir'] = '/var/log/librenms';
  $config['rrd_dir'] = '/var/db/librenms/rrd';

  To relocate the files:

  mkdir /var/log/librenms /var/db/librenms
  chown www:ww: /var/log/librenms /var/db/librenms
  cd /usr/local/www/librenms
  mv rrd /var/db/librenms/
  mv logs/librenms.log /var/log/librenms/
  rmdir logs

  An application key is required. Please follow these steps to generate it:

  cd /usr/local/www/librenms
  cp -i .env.sample .env

  You might need to set your database details in that file.
  Then run:

  php artisan key:generate

  The output should look something like this:

  **************************************
  *     Application In Production!     *
  **************************************

   Do you really wish to run this command? (yes/no) [no]:
   > y

  Application key [base64:P62La9V........qw=] set successfully.

  AFFECTS: databases/postgresql??-server
  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  The PostgreSQL server packages are no longer built with support for the XML
  datatype per default. To retain support for the XML datatype you should build
  the port and check the XML option in the option dialog. The reason for this

  The numerical ID of the "_ntp" user had to be moved after 12.0-CURRENT
  (revision 336525) took over its value for a user "ntpd" that uses a
  different privilege model.

  To avoid clashes between the two users, please remove the openntpd

  sndiod(8) will now use the default audio device /dev/dsp instead
  of /dev/dsp0 if no device was specified.

  The location of ~/.aucat_cookie has moved to ~/.sndio/cookie.  If
  you share audio devices via sndiod(8) on the network or between
  local users, please migrate it manually to the new location to
  guarantee a smooth upgrade.

20180731:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/xorg and all ports with USE_XORG=*proto
  AUTHOR: zeising@FreeBSD.org

  The xorg *proto packages have all been merged into one package,
  x11/xorgproto.  This might cause issues with upgrading.  If you
  get conflicts between xorgproto and old *proto packages, please
  remove the old package and install xorgproto again.

  In order to remove all orphaned ports, including all *proto port,
  the following can be used after the ports tree has been updated:
  pkg version -l \? | cut -f 1 -w | grep -v compat | xargs pkg delete -fy

  AFFECTS: users of dns/dnsdist
  AUTHOR: cpm@FreeBSD.org

  After discussing with several users, we noticed that quite a lot of them
  were not aware that enabling the dnsdist's console without a key, even
  restricted to the local host, could be a security issue and allow privilege
  escalation by allowing an unprivileged user to connect to the console and
  execute Lua code as the dnsdist user. We therefore decided to refuse any
  connection to the console until a key has been set, so please check that
  you do set a key before upgrading if you use the console.

20180704:
  AFFECTS: users of www/gitlab
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  The gitlab port uses the package from gitlab.org instead of github.org.
  For this the port was renamed from gitlab to gitlab-ce.
  Please follow the instructions very carefully to not lose your data!
  Not only the package was renamed, also the directory name changed.

  You can find the current instruction here:
  https://gitlab.fechner.net/mfechner/Gitlab-docu/blob/master/update/10.8-11.0-freebsd.md

  Please note the update was only tested for an update from 10.8.5 to 11.0.2.
  If your version of gitlab was released before 2014-03-13 you cannot update
  to this version. You need to make an intermediate update to an earlier
  version before.

20180612:
  AFFECTS: users of the nox flavor of editors/emacs-devel
  AUTHOR: jrm@FreeBSD.org

  The package name for the nox flavor of editors/emacs-devel changed from
  emacs-devel_nox to emacs-devel-nox.  To install the new package, run

  # pkg install emacs-devel-nox

  pkg should remove the old and install the new package.

20180612:
  AFFECTS: users of packages that depend on Emacs
  AUTHOR: jrm@FreeBSD.org

  With the release of Emacs version 26.1, the major version of editors/emacs
  changed from 25 to 26, so the names of packages that depend on Emacs have also
  changed.  For example, pdf-tools-emacs25-0.80.79_1 is now called
  pdf-tools-emacs26-0.80.79_1.  The name change means simply running `pkg
  upgrade` will not upgrade foo-emacs25-x to foo-emacs26-x.

  To list the packages to upgrade, use

  # pkg info \*emacs25\*

  then install the new version for each with

  # pkg install foo-emacs26

  pkg should remove the old and install the new packages.

20180611:
  AFFECTS: users of PHP based applications
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  Flavors are being added to PHP applications.  When a port is flavorized, pkg
  needs to be told about the name change, for example, if PHP 5.6 is the one
  you need:

  # pkg set -n squirrelmail:squirrelmail-php56

  Most port will have packages for all PHP versions present in the ports tree,
  but some may not be compatible with a specific version.

  To get the available flavors, pkg rquery can be used:

  # pkg rquery %n mail/squirrelmail
  squirrelmail-php56
  squirrelmail-php70
  squirrelmail-php71
  squirrelmail-php72

20180602:
  AFFECTS: users of net/frr
  AUTHOR: olivier@FreeBSD.org

  Due to regression detected in FRR version 4.0, port was renamed to frr4

  # pkg set -n frr:frr4

20180529:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/ibus-typing-booster
  AUTHOR: thierry@FreeBSD.org

  Attention, this release merges all engines into one. Therefore, the
  engine names had to change. The old engine names like "German - DE
  (Typing Booster)", "Hindi - HI (Typing Booster)" don't exist anymore!
  If one has entries for them in the Gnome Control Center or in
  ibus-setup, one needs to remove these old entries and add the new
  engine name "Other (Typing Booster)".

20180518:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/ansible*
  AUTHOR: lifanov@FreeBSD.org

  Ansible ports are now flavored. Package names for Ansible changed
