This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when upgrading
your ports.  We try our best to minimize these disruptions, but sometimes
they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each time
you update your ports collection, before attempting any port upgrades.

  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/avidemux26-*
  AUTHOR: riggs@FreeBSD.org

  avidemux26 has been renamed to avidemux
  If you are using binary pkg, 'pkg upgrade' will do the right thing.
  Users of portmaster/portupgrade have to take a manual step:
  Portmaster users:
      portmaster -o multimedia/avidemux multimedia/avidemux26
  Portupgrade users:
      portupgrade -o multimedia/avidemux multimedia/avidemux26

20150610:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql84-server
  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  PostgreSQL-8.4 EOL was reached in July 2014. To upgrade to a later version of
  choice, you need to do a dump+restore of the database.
  Please follow the instructions at:

     http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/static/install-upgrading.html

20150527:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/xfce4-power-manager
  AUTHOR: olivierd@FreeBSD.org

  Before upgrading, you must stop xfce4-power-manager daemon:

    xfce4-power-manager --quit

20150519:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/webmin and sysutils/usermin
  AUTHOR: olgeni@FreeBSD.org

  After upgrading to Perl 5.20 the /usr/bin/perl link will no longer
  be available. You will have to check your perl-path files and
  change the path of the Perl interpreter to "/usr/local/bin/perl":

    /usr/local/etc/webmin/perl-path
    /usr/local/etc/usermin/perl-path

20150513:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The default Perl version has been switched to Perl 5.20.  If you are using
  binary packages to upgrade your system, you do not have anything to do, pkg
  upgrade will do the right thing.  For the other people, assuming you are
  migrating from 5.18 to 5.20, do:

  Portupgrade users:
	portupgrade -o lang/perl5.20 -f lang/perl5.18

	portupgrade -f `pkg shlib -R libperl.so.5.18|tail +2`

  Portmaster users:
	portmaster -o lang/perl5.20 lang/perl5.18

	portmaster -f `pkg shlib -R libperl.so.5.18|tail +2`

  NOTE:
    Perl has been removed from base more than ten years ago, so it was way past
    time for the /usr/bin/perl symlink to be removed from the port.  If for
    some strange reason, you still need it, you will have to create it
    manually.

  IMPORTANT:
    In case you have not updated your system in a while, and specifically,
    followed the 20141126 instructions regarding the new Perl layout, you
    should follow those more extensive instructions rather than the
    conservative presented here.

20150510:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix mail/postfix-current
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  The following OPTIONS where renamed to match the default used in most all other ports
  - SASL2 -> SASL
  - OPENLDAP -> LDAP

  If any of the old OPTIONS was enabled before, please re-run "make config".

20150508:
  AFFECTS: users of www/iojs
  AUTHOR: linpct@gmail.com

  iojs has been updated to 2.0.0. The binary modules may need to be
  rebuilt due to V8 version ABI change.

20150506:
  AFFECTS: users of net/asterisk13 with PJSIP (default on) and SRTP (default off) options enabled
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  This applies ONLY TO USERS COMPILING FROM PORTS:
  To avoid dependency problems, you must remove the pjsip port
  before upgrading asterisk13.

    # pkg delete pjsip
    # portmaster -a

  These steps are unnecessary for those using binary packages.

  Please see the 20150323 entry for background about this problem.

20150501:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/qgis
  AUTHOR: brd@FreeBSD.org

  Following OPTIONS have been renamed in 2.8.1_1 to match upstream:

  - MAPSERVER to SERVER

20150427:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/opensmtpd
  AUTHOR: ashish@FreeBSD.org

  Following OPTIONS are being removed in 5.4.5p1:

  - LDAP
  - SQLITE
  - MYSQL
  - PGSQL
  - REDIS 
 
  They are disabled/removed in upstream since 5.4.4p1, but did not get removed
  from port.

20150420:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/icu
  AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  icu has been updated to 55.1. Please rebuild all ports that depends on it

  If you use portmaster:
        portmaster -w -r icu
  If you use portupgrade:
        portupgrade -fr devel/icu

20150419
  AFFECTS: Users of emulators/wine-devel
  AUTHOR: gerald@FreeBSD.org


  The COMPHOLIO option in emulators/wine-devel has been renamed to
  STAGING to align with the upstream evolution of that project.

20150417:
  AFFECTS: Users of audio/bcg729
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  The Mediastreamer plugin included in this package has been separated into
  a new port audio/msbcg729.

20150409:
  AFFECTS: User of security/sguil
  AUTHOR: feld@FreeBSD.org

  security/sguil was erroneously provisioned a UID that conflicted with
  the dns/dnscrypt-proxy port. A new UID and GID of 991 has been issued.

  Existing users will be able to upgrade the sguil packages without
  issue. The existing UID will continue to be used. If you do a clean
  install of security/sguil on a new server and migrate files or
  intentionally delete the sguil user and group and reinstall you may
  run into permissions issues.

  Examples include the /var/run/sguild and /usr/local/etc/sguild directories.

20150406:
  AFFECTS: User of emulators/xen emulators/xl and sysutils/xen-tools
  AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  sysutils/xen-tools has been renamed sysutils/xen-guest-tools
  emulators/xl has been renamed sysutils/xen-tools
  emulators/xen has been renamed emulators/xen-kernel
  A new emulators/xen has been introduced, it is a metaport that depends on
  emulators/xen-kernel and sysutils/xen-tools

20150403:
  AFFECTS: Users of irc/rbot
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  Ruby Bot now has a new upstream maintainer.  The project has been updated
  to work with Ruby 2.0+.  Some migration is needed to move away from
  BDB regristry files.  The guide for that is at
  https://github.com/ruby-rbot/rbot/wiki/MigrationGuide

  rbotdb can be used to backup a BDB database and then restore it to a working
  format for the new rbot. Update your conf.yaml after with 'core.db: tc'
  once converted.

20150331:
AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  Subversion modules are no longer activated in httpd.conf!
  To activate the subversion apache modules a dedicated file
  will be installed as modules.d/220_subversion.conf

20150324:
  AFFECTS: Users of dns/bind9*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  This is only for FreeBSD 10.0+.

  BIND auto chroot has been added back to the named rc script.  As enabling it
  by default would most certainly break people's setup, it is not.  To enable
  it, and chroot it in /var/named, add the following line to your rc.conf file:

  named_chrootdir="/var/named"

  On first launch, the rc script will move the /usr/local/etc/namedb directory
  into the chroot, and create a symlink to it.

  Note that, if you're running from within a jail, you need to have a
  /var/named/dev devfs created beforehand, with the null and random devices.

20150323:
  AFFECTS: Users of net/asterisk* and net/pjsip ports
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Due to conflicts between base OpenSSL and ports provided OpenSSL
  library, which is required by net/libsrtp, the srtp support has
  to be removed from the default asterisk13 port configuration,
  otherwise a not working binary would be generated.

  To get SRTP support working in the asterisk ports make sure all
  dependencies are linked against the same SSL library implementation
  to avoid runtime conflicts. On 10.1 everything will work fine
  unless ports SSL libraries are explicitly installed. On older OS
  versions(10.0 and earlier) you will need to compile all ports
  with WITH_OPENSSL_PORT=yes.

  To get working SRTP support in asterisk13 with the pjsip backend
  it is also needed to enable the EXTSRTP option in the pjsip port.

  If the CURL option is enabled also make sure the ftp/curl port
  is using a GSSAPI implementation linking to the same SSL
  implementation the other ports are using (BASE or NONE if you're
  using base OpenSSL, GSSAPI_HEIMDAL GSSAPI_MIT otherwise). If an
  incompatible option is being used the curl module will cause
  asterisk to fail on startup due to mixing calls to OpenSSL from
  base and from ports.

20150322:
  AFFECTS: Users of security/openssh-portable
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  The port now uses VersionAddendum for the port version string. Setting
  the value to "none" in your sshd_config and restarting openssh will allow
  removing the version from the banner.

20150321:
  AFFECTS: Users of x11-servers/xorg-server and other X servers
  AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  All fonts ports have been modified to respect XDG and install in
  share/fonts

  The Xorg servers now are looking there by default

  If you experience font related issues, view the output of

  # fc-list

  If the list appears incomplete or has fonts still pointing to
  /usr/local/lib/X11/fonts you may forcibly update the font cache:

  # fc-cache -fs

20150317:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/openoffice-4 and editors/openoffice-devel
  AUTHOR: truckman@FreeBSD.org

  Contrary to what is stated in pkg-message, openoffice-4 and
  openoffice-devel have stored user settings in ~/.openoffice.org-devel/4
  since r325370 (2013-08-25). This update expects user settings to reside
  in the more standard ~/.openoffice.org/4.

  To preserve your user settings, rename or copy them from
  ~/.openoffice.org-devel/4 to ~/.openoffice.org/4. when installing this
  update to apache-openoffice-4.1.1_7 or
  apache-openoffice-devel-4.2.1652526_2,3.

20150313:
  AFFECTS: users of net/serviio
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  The Java Polling Watch Service used in Serviio 1.5.1 is fixed. If you
  unchecked "Keep library automatically updated" with 1.5 (as recommended
  in the 20150206 entry) you can enable it again.

20150309:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netdisco
  AUTHOR: dgeo@centrale-marseille.fr

  netdisco version has been upgraded to netdisco2

  After upgrading, you will need to review all your configuration, as
  this new version won't read old config files.
  You'll be able to keep your data though netdisco-deploy command

20150305:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-wm/xfce4 and multimedia/xfce4-parole
  AUTHOR: olivierd@FreeBSD.org

  Xfce 4.12 has been imported. Please use the following instructions to
  upgrade.

  For package users:
  # pkg upgrade

  For ports users:
  # portmaster -a
  # portmaster x11-wm/xfce4

  GStreamer 1.0 is enabled by default in Parole media player.

  Xfce 4.12 now depends of Adwaita icon theme. If you are upgrading from
  Xfce 4.10 you probably still have the Tango or GNOME theme selected.
  Open the Settings Manager and select Appearance. Inside dialog box switch
  to the Icons tag and select the "Adwaita" entry in the list.

20150304:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: vsevolod@highsecure.ru

  After upgrading of libressl you should manually update all packages that
  depending on this library since its version has been changed. Normally,
  you could obtain the list of dependent software by running the following
  command:

  pkg query -e '%n = libressl' %ro

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies.

20150301:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby20
  AUTHOR: swills@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 2.0 to 2.1.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 2.0 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 2.0 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ruby=2.0

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  software that uses ruby. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  upon how you manage your system.

  If you use pkgng, simply upgrade:
  # pkg upgrade -f

  If you use portmaster, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:
  # portmaster -o lang/ruby21 lang/ruby20
  # portmaster -R -r ruby-2.1

  If you use portupgrade, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:

  # pkg delete -f ruby portupgrade
  # make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portupgrade install clean
  # pkg set -o lang/ruby20:lang/ruby21
  # portupgrade -x ruby-2.1.\* -fr lang/ruby21

20150227:
  AFFECTS: Users of games/trigger
  AUTHOR: makc@FreeBSD.org

  games/trigger has been split and renamed to games/trigger-rally
  and games/trigger-data ports. Deinstall previous version
  before upgrading.

20150224:
  AFFECTS: Users of devel/qt4-linguist
  AUTHOR: makc@FreeBSD.org

  Linguist tools have been moved from qt4-linguist port to new
  devel/qt4-linguisttools port. Deinstall qt4-linguist before
  upgrading.

20150224:
  AFFECTS: Users of lang/ruby19

  lang/ruby19 has reached its end-of-life and has been removed.  The
  default version has been 2.0 for a while.  Other available versions
  are Ruby 2.1 and Ruby 2.2.

  Users who have DEFAULT_VERSIONS=ruby=1.9 in their /etc/make.conf are
  encouraged to remove it or change it to an available version.

20150224:
  AFFECTS: Users of net-p2p/bitcoin (cli utilities)

  The bitcoin-cli and bitcoin-tx utilities have been re-packaged into
  a separate port. If you require these programs, or use the bitcoin-cli
  program to access the daemon or the GUI, install net-p2p/bitcoin-utils
  to reinstall them.

20150220:
  AFFECTS: users of PHP

  The default PHP version has been updated from 5.4 to 5.6.

  If you use binary packages you should make a list of php packages
  before running 'pkg upgrade':

  # pkg info php5\* > ~/installed-php-ports-list

  After the upgrade, check with such list if all your php extensions
  are still installed, and reinstall them if needed.

20150213:
  AFFECTS: users who upgraded from FreeBSD 7.x or older with "make world" but never ran "make delete-old"
  AUTHOR: antoine@FreeBSD.org

  Dependency registration has been reworked.
  If you encounter the following error,  you may have stale magic files
  for file(1):

    ===>   bar-x depends on shared library: libfoo.so - not found

  You can remove the stale /usr/share/misc/magic.mime{,.mgc} files
  manually or run "make delete-old" in ${SRCDIR}.

20150207:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/opensmtpd-devel
  AUTHOR: ashish@FreeBSD.org

  MYSQL, PGSQL, LDAP, and REDIS options are removed from port, as
  they're moved upstream to a separate project, which is yet to
  release snapshots. If you need those options, then please install
  "mail/opensmtpd" port instead. To do that:

  If using portupgrade:
  # portupgrade -o mail/opensmtpd mail/opensmtpd-devel

  If using portmaster:
  # portmaster -o mail/opensmtpd mail/opensmtpd-devel

20150206:
  AFFECTS: users of net/serviio
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  The java dependency changed from java 7 (java/openjdk7 if you haven't
  installed another java 7 implementation) to java 8 (e.g. java/openjdk8).
  If serviio is the only reason that java 7 is installed, you can delete
  java 7 after the update to serviio 1.5.0.

  The Java Polling Watch Service used in Serviio 1.5 aggressively searches
  for file system updates. Until the Serviio poller is re-enabled in 1.5.1,
  consider unchecking "Keep library automatically updated" if you have a
  large media collection or are concerned about CPU/disk usage.

20150204:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql55-(server|client)
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  The default MySQL version has been updated from 5.5 to 5.6.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 5.5 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep MySQL 5.5 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=mysql= 5.5 

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  running server instance. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  on installed packages.

  # pkg set -o databases/mysql55-client:databases/mysql56-client
  # pkg set -o databases/mysql55-server:databases/mysql56-server
  # pkg upgrade

20150118:
  AFFECTS: users of www/thttpd
  AUTHOR: danfe@FreeBSD.org

  thttpd was updated to version 2.26, which brings several user-noticeable
  changes to the port:

    - Default WWW root was changed from ${PREFIX}/www/data to more expected
      (and standard) ${WWWDIR} (${PREFIX}/www/thttpd), be sure to check and
      adjust your thttpd configuration file and/or web layout accordingly;
    - Default CGI pattern was changed to "/cgi-bin/*"; this goes better in
      line with default installation;
    - Default data MIME type was changed to "application/octet-stream";
    - thttpd's own htpasswd(1) program, which was previously installed as
      thttpdpasswd(1) to avoid conflict with other webservers, is now being
      renamed to thtpasswd(1); this not just makes it shorter, but is more
      consistent with popular GNU/Linux distributions;
    - Index pages for directories are not generated by default from now on
      for security reasons; an option (INDEXES) is provided to turn them
      back on if they are wanted;
    - IPREAL option (to respect (pass on) "X-Forwarded-For" header) is now
      turned on by default: it is often required when thttpd is used as a
      CGI server behind nginx (http://wiki.nginx.org/ThttpdCGI).

20150113:
  AFFECTS: users of www/pecl-http
  AUTHOR: vanilla@FreeBSD.org

  The pecl-http has been upgraded to version 2.1.4, and the new version is
  not compatible with the old one.  If you need the "old" 1.7.6, you can
  find it in www/pecl-http1.

20150111:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/python3
  AUTHOR: demon@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of python3 has changed from 3.3 to 3.4.
  If you wish to stick with older version, add "python3=3.3" to your
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS variable in /etc/make.conf.  To upgrade:

  If using portupgrade:
  # portupgrade -o lang/python34 lang/python33

  If using portmaster:
  # portmaster -o lang/python34 lang/python33

20150109:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/speex
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  The audio/speex port has been updated to 1.2rc2 and one of the libraries
  it installed has been split off into a new port audio/speexdsp.  Before
  you can update audio/speex you must first delete the old package using
  "pkg del -f speex".

20150101:
  AFFECTS: users of net/unison and net/unison-nox11
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Unison has been upgraded to version 2.48, which uses a different wire
  protocol than 2.40 did.  In order to support synchronization with
  other computers where Unison is still at version 2.40, a new port
  net/unison240 has been created.  It provides unison240 and if that is
  GTK2-enabled, also unison240-text.  This unison240 port can be
  installed in parallel with the existing net/unison port.

20141230:
  AFFECTS: users of deskutils/xpad
  AUTHOR: jgh@FreeBSD.org

  deskutils/xpad has been moved to deskutils/xpad3, since 4.x has been around
  for a while.

  Should you wish to stick with legacy branch at this time;

  # portmaster -o deskutils/xpad deskutils/xpad3

20141225:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/png
  AUTHOR: antoine@FreeBSD.org

  The PNG library has been updated to version 1.6.16.  Please rebuild all
  ports that depend on it.

  If you use portmaster:
        portmaster -r png
  If you use portupgrade:
        portupgrade -fr graphics/png

20141224:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/neon29
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  The port www/neon29 was renamed to www/neon and updated to version 0.30.1

  If you use pkg, simply upgrade:

	# pkg upgrade

  If you use portmaster, rebuild ports that depend on neon:

	# portmaster -o www/neon www/neon29
	# portmaster -R -r neon

20141219:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/xorg and all xorg ports
  AUTHOR: dumbbell@FreeBSD.org

  The X.Org server (x11-servers/xorg-server) is updated to 1.14. All
  ports which provide X.Org drivers must be updated simultaneously, i.e.
  x11-drivers/xf86-*, emulators/virtualbox-ose-additions, net/tigervnc,
  etc.

  The input device autodetection backend is switched from HAL to devd.
  If you configure your keyboard layout through HAL .fdi files, you need
  to migrate this configuration to plain X.Org configuration files.

  Up-to-date instructions and a description of the changes brought by
  this update are detailed in a blog post:

20141219:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/xymon-server
  AUTHOR: feld@FreeBSD.org

  Xymon has been updated to 4.3.18. A major change is the replacement of
  the individual cgi shell scripts with symlinks to a cgi program written
  in C. This is to mitigate shellshock on Linux systems where the
  /bin/sh -> /bin/bash. FreeBSD users were not exposed except in the
  most unusual and unsupported circumstances. However, this is an
  important update for security. This change could break your
  configuration as Henrik describes here:

  > NOTE: Replacing the shell script wrappers means that the cgioptions.cfg
  > file is no longer processed as a shell script. The new wrapper works
  > fine with the default version of cgioptions.cfg, but it you have
  > modified it in a way that it relies on being processed by a shell, then
  > it will break.

20141219:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/abcde
  AUTHOR: gblach@FreeBSD.org

  In audio/abcde dependency has been changed from audio/py-eyed3-06
  to audio/py-eyed3. Before updating audio/abcde to 2.6 you must manually
  deinstall audio/py-eyed-06:

	# pkg delete -f py\*-eyed3-06

20141218:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openssh-portable
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  OpenSSH 6.7 disables some insecure ciphers by default, such as arcfour
  and blowfish. You may have clients using these over LAN where security is
  considered less important for the connection. For these cases you may need
  to update your Ciphers entry in your sshd_config to enable them again.

  See http://mgalgs.github.io/2014/10/22/enable-arcfour-and-other-fast-ciphers-on-recent-versions-of-openssh.html

20141217:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  Perl now links all .so it builds with libperl.so, it makes upgrading from one
  Perl major version to another way easier.  For binary package users, it means
  pkg upgrade will detect the libperl.so.x.yy change, and reinstall the
  affected packages.  For users using ports, it will save rebuild time as it's
  easier to detect what ports really need to be rebuilt.

  Ports users are encouraged to rebuild ports that install files in SITE_ARCH.
  If using Perl 5.18, run:

  With portupgrade:

    portupgrade -f `find /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/mach/5.18 -name '*.so'|xargs pkg which -qo|sort -u`

  With portmaster:

    portmaster `find /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/mach/5.18 -name '*.so'|xargs pkg which -qo|sort -u`

20141216:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openssh-portable, security/openssh-portable66
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  All patches have been fixed for version 6.7. It is no longer required to use
  the security/openssh-portable66 port.

  The LPK option was removed from security/openssh-portable as it has been
  deprecated since May 2013. Use AuthorizedKeysCommand as a replacement.

20141215:
  AFFECTS: users of comms/spandsp-devel
  AUTHOR: pawel@FreeBSD.org

  comms/spandsp has been upgraded to version 0.0.6
  comms/spandsp-devel is now deprecated and set for removal, all ports using
  it were converted to use newer comms/spandsp. Before upgrade you must
  remove comms/spandsp-devel so that ports can pick up new dependency:

	# pkg delete -f spandsp-devel

20141215:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/linux_base-f10 and emulators/linux_base-c6
  AUTHOR: sbruno@freebsd.org

  The CentOS ports are now the default for stable/10 (after revision 275807).
  See UPDATING entry 20141209 for details on migration of systems.

20141214:
  AFFECTS: users of TeXLive
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  Several scripts in print/texlive-base have been moved to
  devel/tex-kpathsea.  Upgrading them can fail because texlive-base

  AFFECTS: users of emulators/linux_base-f10 and emulators/linux_base-c6
  AUTHOR: xmj@freebsd.org

  The CentOS ports infrastructure has replaced Fedora 10 as default.

  1. Please delete all remaining f10 ports/packages:

     # pkg delete -f linux_base-f10 linux-f10-\*

  2. Persistently update the Linux kernel version in /etc/sysctl.conf:

     compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.18

    This step is necessary on all FreeBSD versions, apart from 11.0-CURRENT
    (after revision 271982).

  3. Reinstall all software depending on Linux emulation.
     As an example, reinstall linux-firefox:

     # portmaster -r linux-firefox
       or
     # portupgrade -f www/linux-firefox
       or
     # pkg install linux-firefox

  If difficulties are encountered, please follow the UPDATING entry 20140922
  but skip step 2 (OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT and OVERRIDE_LINUX_NONBASE_PORTS
  in /etc/make.conf). In case these steps do not fix the issues, please submit
  an issue report in Bugzilla and send an email to FreeBSD's emulation@ mailing
  list.

  Users who need to continue using Fedora 10 base and userland should do the
  following instead:

  1. Add these lines to /etc/make.conf:

      OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT=f10
      OVERRIDE_LINUX_NONBASE_PORTS=f10

  2. Downgrade the Linux kernel version in /etc/sysctl.conf on FreeBSD versions
     newer than and including 11.0-CURRENT (after revision 271982).

       compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.16

  This is all that is needed to continue using an existing Fedora 10 Linux base
  and userland.

  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The directories where Perl modules are installed has changed.  All
  affected ports' PORTREVISION have been bumped, so upgrading should
  be as painless as possible.  The old directories have been kept in
  the default Perl @INC to make it even more painless.

  The default Perl has been switched to lang/perl5.18.  These examples
  are for switching from lang/perl5.16, if you are running a different
  version, replace lang/perl5.16 with the origin of the Perl you have
  installed.

  Binary package users:

    # pkg upgrade -f

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
        pkgdb -Ff

    1) Reinstall new version of Perl (5.18):
        portupgrade -o lang/perl5.18 -f lang/perl5.16

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
        portupgrade -fr lang/perl5.18

  Portmaster users:
        portmaster -o lang/perl5.18 lang/perl5.16

        Conservative:
        portmaster p5-

        Comprehensive (but perhaps overkill):
        portmaster -r perl5-

  Note: If the "perl5-" glob matches more than one port you will need to specify
        the name of the installed Perl package explicitly.  You can get its name
        by running: pkg info perl5

  #
  # Keep ruby 1.9 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ruby=1.9

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  software that uses ruby. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending

  AFFECTS: users of shells/bash
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  Bash supports a feature of exporting functions in the environment with
  export -f.  Running bash with exported functions in the environment will
  then import those functions into the environment of the script being ran.
  This resulted in security issues CVE-2014-6271 and CVE-2014-7169, commonly
  known as "shellshock".  It also can result in poorly written scripts being
  tricked into running arbitrary commands.

  To fully mitigate against this sort of attack we have applied a non-upstream
  patch to disable this functionality by default.  You can execute bash
  with --import-functions to allow it to import functions from the
  environment.  The default can also be changed in the port by selecting the
  IMPORTFUNCTIONS option.

20140926:
  AFFECTS: users of net/asterisk and net/asterisk11
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  The asterisk ports have been modified to have the LUA option
  turned on by default to make such functionality available to users
  of binary packages.

  Some care should be taken before upgrading by people not using Lua
  to avoid the sample extensions.lua file from being loaded on reload
  after updating the asterisk port/pkg.

  Users compiling from ports not interested in LUA support are advised
  to disable the option before updating.

  People using binary packages(or not wanting to disable the LUA
  option in the port) not using the Lua functionality should add:

	noload => pbx_lua.so

  to the PREFIX/etc/asterisk/modules.conf file, if using the
  autoload=yes option in that same file. People not autoloading
  modules don't need to perform any special action.

  If asterisk is rebooted and the pbx_lua module gets loaded on a
  system were it should not, it will load the example extensions.lua
  configuration file adding unexpected logic to your dialplan. In
  such a case following the above steps and reloading asterisk will
  fix the problem.

  AUTHOR: xmj@FreeBSD.org

  The complete drop-in replacement linux-c6 port infrastructure is in
  ports and will shortly replace the current linux-f10- ports as default.

  To switch to the linux-c6 infrastructure:

  0. Back up all your vital information!
  1. Remove the current linux base port and all linux-f10- ports:
       # pkg delete -f linux_base-f10 linux-f10-\*
  2. Add these lines to /etc/make.conf:
       OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT=c6
       OVERRIDE_LINUX_NONBASE_PORTS=c6
  3. Make sure no Linux application is running.
  4. Update the Linux kernel version in /etc/sysctl.conf:
       compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.18
     Make it take effect immediately:
       # sysctl compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.18
  5. Install emulators/linux-c6.

  These steps are usually sufficient. If there are difficulties, expand
  step 1 to:

  1a. Remove all ports which depend on the linux base port.
  1b. Remove the linux base port.
  1c. Clean the /compat/linux/ directory.

  If there are any other difficulties not fixed by these extended steps,
  please submit an issue report in Bugzilla and send an email to
  FreeBSD's emulation@ mailing list.

  AFFECTS: users seeing build errors about missing *.la files
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  We are in the process of adjusting or, if possible, removing libtool archives
  (*.la files) from all ports because they can otherwise cause overlinking
  between packages.  This is the problem where in the dependency chain A->B->C
  an extra link is added from A to C even if A does not use C directly.  This
  makes some updates to port C expensive because then both A and B have to be
  rebuilt instead of just B.

  This is mostly behind the scenes work that you won't notice.  In fact most
  ports have already been converted.  You may however run into build errors
  about missing *.la files if a port update in the past went wrong and left
  behind *.la files with references to other *.la files that are no longer
  there.  In this case, please run the following command:

  find /usr/local/lib -name '*.la' | xargs grep -l 'libfoo\.la' | xargs pkg which
  (Replace libfoo\.la with the *.la file that is missing.)

  This command will print a list of *.la files that refer to the missing *.la
  file and what package they belong to.  First, where it says "not found in
  the database", remove the *.la file.  After removing all such files, where
  it says "installed by package X", rebuild X.  Eventually the list printed by
  that command will be empty and the build error should be gone.

  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  HEADS UP: for some applications that store their data in Berkeley DB
  databases, you may have to export the data before the upgrade and
  reload it afterwards.  Detailed instructions are at
  <https://wiki.freebsd.org/Ports/BerkeleyDBCleanup>.

  The older databases/db4* ports providing versions 4.0 to 4.7
  inclusively have been removed, and 4.8 has been deprecated.
  The default Berkeley DB version is now 5.3.
  (6.x has a different license, but will be eligible as default on
  systems that build ports from source and have db6 installed.)
    All enabled and working ports have been changed such that they use
  Berkeley DB 4.8 or newer, and an -exp run has been made.

  After you have performed the first steps from the Wiki documentation,
  and have arrived at a step that reads "build all applications", then
  type as privileged user and without the hash sign:

  # Tools/scripts/BDB-upgrade-helper.sh

  The helper script requires that ports-mgmt/portmaster or
  .../portupgrade is installed, will try to upgrade your applications
  with either of these tools (portmaster preferred), and if that succeeds,
  it will attempt to delete the packages if confirmed interactively.

  # portmaster -r ilmbase -r OpenEXR
    or
  # portupgrade -fr graphics/ilmbase graphics/OpenEXR

  The PORTREVISIONs of all ports that require ilmbase and/or OpenEXR
  have been bumped.

  AUTHOR: haskell@FreeBSD.org

  The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compiler has been updated to version
  7.8.3 and Haskell Platform to 2014.2.0.0.  Hence it is recommended to
  rebuild or reinstall all the dependent ports and the lang/ghc port
  itself by one of the following commands:

  # portmaster -w -r ghc
    or
  # portupgrade -fr lang/ghc

  If you use pkg(8) then it is just safer to remove all the GHC-dependent
  packages along with GHC and reinstall everything from scratch.
  Something alone these lines may work:

  # pkg query "%ro" > ghc-pkgs.txt
  # pkg delete -y lang/ghc

  AFFECTS: users of net/GeoIP
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  GeoIP no longer ships with the GeoIP database. To continue using GeoIP,
  you MUST fetch the database after upgrading by running geoipupdate.sh.

20140727:
  AFFECTS: users of comms/qpage
  AUTHOR: marino@FreeBSD.org

  The default configure file location has changed from
  ${LOCALBASE}/etc/qpage.cf to ${LOCALBASE}/etc/qpage.conf
  You will likely want to move the old configure file to the new location
  after updating if it contains custom settings.

20140725:
  AFFECTS: users of cad/netgen
  AUTHOR: stephen@FreeBSD.org

  Before you update this port the old one should be removed.  (This is
  because the build may try to link to libraries that are in
  ${LOCALBASE}/lib rather than in ${WRKSRC}.)

20140724:
  AFFECTS: users of dns/mydns-ng
  AUTHOR: danilo@FreeBSD.org

  The dns/mydns-ng port no longer has the suffix (-mysql|-pgsql). Before
  you update this port the old one must be removed:

  pkg remove mydns-ng-mysql
    or
  pkg remove mysql-ng-pgsql

20140723:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/libevent

  libevent1 has been replaced by libevent2 via the compatibility layer.
  All applications that used libevent1 must be rebuilt.

  Please remove libevent1 before upgrading, by running:

	pkg delete -f libevent

20140723:
  AFFECTS: users of security/scanlogd
  AUTHOR: tgyurci@gmail.com

  The security/scanlogd port now creates scanlogd user and group. Previous
  scanlogd user and group must be removed before updating to not conflict
  with the one created by the port:

	pw userdel scanlogd
	pw groupdel scanlogd

20140723:
  AFFECTS: users of TeX
  AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  TeXLive is now the default teX provider.
  Please remove all TeX-related packages based on teTeX.

20140722:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/exim
  AUTHOR: vsevolod@FreeBSD.org

  The behaviour of expansion of arguments to math comparison functions (<,
  <=, =, =>, >) was unexpected, expanding the values twice. Please update
  your configuration if you have relied on such an expansion.

20140722:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/mediainfo
  AUTHOR: sunpoet@FreeBSD.org

  mediainfo has been split into 3 ports: libzen, libmediainfo and mediainfo.
  Please uninstall mediainfo before you update this port.

20140722:
  AFFECTS: users of games/bsdgames
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  Please disregard any prior instructions about moving your game data to
  /usr/local/var/games. If you have done this, please move it back to
  /var/games.

20140714:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/db6
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  Oracle Berkeley DB 6 has been upgraded to version 6.1.19.  Since the
  previous 6.0 version, the log file format has changed in 6.1.
  Depending on applications used, you may need to take action BEFORE you
  upgrade.  For details, please see the online upgrade manual at
  <http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17076_04/html/upgrading/upgrade_process.html>
  <http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17076_04/html/installation/upgrade_61_toc.html>

  Note: if you've got Apache installed and depending on db6, you may
  need to upgrade it separately BEFORE upgrading other ports, such as
  Apache modules.

  After that, you must rebuild all applications that link to db6 because
  the shared library name has changed with the upgrade.  To do that:

  If you use portmaster:
        portmaster -w -r db6-
  If you use portupgrade:
        portupgrade -fr databases/db6

20140714:
  AFFECTS: users of net/linphone-base
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  Linphone has been updated to version 3.7.0 and the linphone-base port
  has been split into separate components.  You must first delete the
  linphone-base package before you can update ports that depend on it.

  pkg del -f linphone-base
    or
  pkg_delete -f linphone-base\*

20140713:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix-current
  AUTHOR: sahil@FreeBSD.org

  This is a significant update; so, please carefully review the
  RELEASE_NOTES to identify which incompatible changes impact your
  environment. Of particular note are changes to the Postfix
  build/install procedure.

  Please backup main.cf, master.cf and any other important files
  associated with your Postfix setup before updating.

20140713:
  AFFECTS: users of www/apache22
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  The default version was changed from www/apache22 to www/apache24,
  pre-build apache modules and web applications will also reflect this!

  In case ports are build by yourself and apache22 is required
  use the following command to keep apache22 as default.

  # echo "DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=apache=2.2" >> /etc/make.conf

20140710:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/rust
  AUTHOR: robak@FreeBSD.org

  The lang/rust port was updated to 0.11 and is now only working on FreeBSD
  versions 10 and 11 -- the 9.x support has been removed by upstream.

20140709:
  AFFECTS: users of security/pam-pgsql
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  The pam_pgsql.so module is now installed in PREFIX/lib (/usr/local/lib)
  instead of /usr/lib.

20140627:
  AFFECTS: Users of Java
  AUTHOR: swills@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of OpenJDK has been updated from 1.6 to 1.7. To update,
  users of Java will need to rebuild all ports that depend on Java:

  If you use pkg (regardless of if you build ports from source or install
  binary packages):
  # pkg set -o java/openjdk6:java/openjdk7

  If you use portmaster to build ports from source:

  # portmaster -o java/openjdk7 openjdk6
  # portmaster -R -r openjdk

  If you use portupgrade to build ports from source:

  # portupgrade -fo java/openjdk7 java/openjdk6

  If you use pkg to install prebuilt binary packages:

  # pkg install -fR java/openjdk7

  If you wish to keep the 1.6 version as default, add the following lines to
  your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep OpenJDK 1.6 as default version.
  #
  JAVA_PREFERRED_PORTS=JAVA_PORT_NATIVE_OPENJDK_JDK_1_6

20140627:
  AFFECTS: users of security/amavisd-milter
  AUTHOR: delphij@FreeBSD.org

  The default working directory of security/amavisd-milter have been
  changed to /var/run/amavis/.  Users will have to adjust path to the
  milter socket.

20140627:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/emacs21 and editors/emacs22
  AUTHOR: ashish@FreeBSD.org

  editors/emacs21, and editors/emacs22 are removed as they were
  unmaintained upstream for a while. Their dependent ports are removed
  as well. Please switch to editors/emacs (Emacs 24 release), or
  editors/emacs23 (Emacs 23 release), or editors/emacs-devel (Emacs
  development branch) ports.

20140626:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/qmail-spamcontrol
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  Spamcontrol has been updated to the 2.7 release.

  It is advised to read the release notes as some features were removed and
  others reworked.

  http://www.fehcom.de/qmail/spamcontrol/RELEASE_27.spamcontrol

  2.7 manual: http://www.fehcom.de/qmail/spamcontrol/README_spamcontrol.html

20140626:
  AFFECTS: users of comms/smstools3
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  The smstools3 startup screen has been modified to allow smsd to
  change uid/gid by itself. The rc options smsd_logfile, smsd_user
  and smsd_group are not supported anymore, user, group and log
  filename should be specified in the configuration file.

  The sample configuration file has been updated to have defaults
  equivalent to the old ones.

20140624:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/p5-Bucardo
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The bucardo_ctl script has been renamed to bucardo, so, to follow the naming,
  the bucardo_ctl_enable rc variable has been renamed to bucardo_enable.

20140622:
  AFFECTS: users of security/gpgme
  AUTHOR: jhale@FreeBSD.org

  If you have both security/gnupg AND security/gnupg1 installed, gpgme will
  now automatically detect and use security/gnupg.  Specifically, it will
  search for gpgconf(1) first and use the paths for the binaries provided
  by it.  Failing that, it will search for a binary named "gpg".

  It is no longer possible to specify the location of the gpg binary at
  buildtime to differentiate between version 1.x and version 2.x.  The port
  options GNUPG1 and GNUPG2 now merely add their respective versions of gnupg
  as build and runtime dependencies.

20140618:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/m17n-* textproc/*m17n*
  AUTHOR: Nikola Lecic <nikola.lecic@anthesphoria.net>

  devel/m17n-db now incorporates a set of user-contributed input methods and
  a conversion script, formerly available through textproc/m17n-contrib.
  Delete textproc/m17n-contrib first and then update/install devel/m17n-db.

20140616:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/subversion
  AUTHOR: lev@FreeBSD.org

  The subversion port has been overhauled. Some optional parts were extracted
  into separate ports. These ports are:

  www/mod_dav_svn
    instead of option MOD_DAV_SVN.
  security/subversion-gnome-keyring
    instead of option GNOME_KEYRING.
  security/subversion-kwallet
    instead of option KDE_KWALLET.

  If you used devel/subversion with one (or more) of these non-standard
  options, you should install the appropriate port(s) after upgrading
  subversion.

  "mod_dontdothat" is installed unconditionally by www/mod_dav_svn port (it
  depended on the TOOLS option before), but is not activated by default, you
  may need to edit apache's configuration file.

  The devel/subversion port now installs svndiff, svndiff3 and svndiff4
  commands if TOOLS option is enabled. They was skipped before.
  The official names "diff", "diff3" and "diff4" are prefixed with "svn" to
  avoid conflicts with base and other diff versions.

  All libraries and binaries are now stripped if the MAINTAINER_DEBUG
  option is not selected (including all sub-ports, like bindings
  and mod_dav_svn).
