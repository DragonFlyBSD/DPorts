This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when upgrading
your ports.  We try our best to minimize these disruptions, but sometimes
they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each time
you update your ports collection, before attempting any port upgrades.

20140710:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/rust
  AUTHOR: robak@FreeBSD.org

  The lang/rust port was updated to 0.11 and is now only working on FreeBSD
  versions 10 and 11 - the 9.x support has been removed by upstream.

20140709:
  AFFECTS: users of security/pam-pgsql
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  The pam_pgsql.so module is now installed in PREFIX/lib (/usr/local/lib)
  instead of /usr/lib.

20140627:
  AFFECTS: Users of Java
  AUTHOR: swills@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of OpenJDK has been updated from 1.6 to 1.7. To update,
  users of Java will need to rebuild all ports that depend on Java:

  If you use pkg (regardless of if you build ports from source or install
  binary packages):
  # pkg set -o java/openjdk6:java/openjdk7

  If you use portmaster to build ports from source:

  # portmaster -o java/openjdk7 openjdk6
  # portmaster -R -r openjdk

  If you use portupgrade to build ports from source:

  # portupgrade -fo java/openjdk7 java/openjdk6

  If you use pkg to install prebuilt binary packages:

  # pkg install -fR java/openjdk7

  If you wish to keep the 1.6 version as default, add the following lines to
  your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep OpenJDK 1.6 as default version.
  #
  JAVA_PREFERRED_PORTS=JAVA_PORT_NATIVE_OPENJDK_JDK_1_6

20140627:
  AFFECTS: users of security/amavisd-milter
  AUTHOR: delphij@FreeBSD.org

  The default working directory of security/amavisd-milter have been
  changed to /var/run/amavis/.  Users will have to adjust path to the
  milter socket.

20140627:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/emacs21 and editors/emacs22
  AUTHOR: ashish@FreeBSD.org

  editors/emacs21, and editors/emacs22 are removed as they were
  unmaintained upstream for a while. Their dependent ports are removed
  as well. Please switch to editors/emacs (Emacs 24 release), or
  editors/emacs23 (Emacs 23 release), or editors/emacs-devel (Emacs
  development branch) ports.

20140626:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/qmail-spamcontrol
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  Spamcontrol has been updated to the 2.7 release.

  It is advised to read the release notes as some features were removed and
  others reworked.

  http://www.fehcom.de/qmail/spamcontrol/RELEASE_27.spamcontrol

  2.7 manual: http://www.fehcom.de/qmail/spamcontrol/README_spamcontrol.html

20140626:
  AFFECTS: users of comms/smstools3
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  The smstools3 startup screen has been modified to allow smsd to
  change uid/gid by itself. The rc options smsd_logfile, smsd_user
  and smsd_group are not supported anymore, user, group and log
  filename should be specified in the configuration file.

  The sample configuration file has been updated to have defaults
  equivalent to the old ones.

20140624:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/p5-Bucardo
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The bucardo_ctl script has been renamed to bucardo, so, to follow the naming,
  the bucardo_ctl_enable rc variable has been renamed to bucardo_enable.

20140622:
  AFFECTS: users of security/gpgme
  AUTHOR: jhale@FreeBSD.org

  If you have both security/gnupg AND security/gnupg1 installed, gpgme will
  now automatically detect and use security/gnupg.  Specifically, it will
  search for gpgconf(1) first and use the paths for the binaries provided
  by it.  Failing that, it will search for a binary named "gpg".

  It is no longer possible to specify the location of the gpg binary at
  buildtime to differentiate between version 1.x and version 2.x.  The port
  options GNUPG1 and GNUPG2 now merely add their respective versions of gnupg
  as build and runtime dependencies.

20140618:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/m17n-* textproc/*m17n*
  AUTHOR: Nikola Lecic <nikola.lecic@anthesphoria.net>

  devel/m17n-db now incorporates a set of user-contributed input methods and
  a conversion script, formerly available through textproc/m17n-contrib.
  Delete textproc/m17n-contrib first and then update/install devel/m17n-db.

20140616:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/subversion
  AUTHOR: lev@FreeBSD.org

  The subversion port has been overhauled. Some optional parts were extracted
  into separate ports. These ports are:

  www/mod_dav_svn
    instead of option MOD_DAV_SVN.
  security/subversion-gnome-keyring
    instead of option GNOME_KEYRING.
  security/subversion-kwallet
    instead of option KDE_KWALLET.

  If you used devel/subversion with one (or more) of these non-standard
  options, you should install the appropriate port(s) after upgrading
  subversion.

  "mod_dontdothat" is installed unconditionally by www/mod_dav_svn port (it
  depended on the TOOLS option before), but is not activated by default, you
  may need to edit apache's configuration file.

  The devel/subversion port now installs svndiff, svndiff3 and svndiff4
  commands if TOOLS option is enabled. They was skipped before.
  The official names "diff", "diff3" and "diff4" are prefixed with "svn" to
  avoid conflicts with base and other diff versions.

  All libraries and binaries are now stripped if the MAINTAINER_DEBUG
  option is not selected (including all sub-ports, like bindings
  and mod_dav_svn).

20140611:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/icu
  AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  icu has been updated to 53.1. Please rebuild all ports that depend on it

  If you use portmaster:
        portmaster -w -r icu
  If you use portupgrade:
        portupgrade -fr devel/icu
  If you use pkgng with binary packages:
        pkg install -fR devel/icu

20140610:
  AFFECTS: users of www/firefox, www/seamonkey, mail/thunderbird, www/libxul
  AUTHOR: gecko@FreeBSD.org

  Gecko ports were switched to use more system libraries. Some of them
  must be built with certain options unset (default).
  - audio/soundtouch has to be installed with INTEGER_SAMPLES option disabled

20140604:
  AFFECTS: users of dns/dnscrypt-proxy
  AUTHOR: feld@FreeBSD.org

  The 1.4.0 update to dns/dnscrypt-proxy introduced a privilege
  separation capability utilizing the new _dnscrypt-proxy user.
  The home directory for this user was misconfigured as /nonexistent.
  The dnscrypt-proxy server will try to chroot to _dnscrypt-proxy's home
  directory and fail to start. If you are affected you will need to
  change _dnscrypt-proxy's home directory to /var/empty:

  # pw usermod _dnscrypt-proxy -d /var/empty

20140603:
  AFFECTS: users of net-p2p/zetacoin
  AUTHOR: daniel@morante.net

  The zetacoind process now runs as the zetacoin user. Please make sure that
  this user has appropriate permissions to the blockchain database and wallet
  directory.

  If you are using the default path, run:

  # chown -R zetacoin:zetacoin /var/db/zetacoin
  # chown -R zetacoin:zetacoin /.zetacoin

20140529:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql??-(server|client)
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  PostgreSQL version 9.2 is now the default. To upgrade from a version
  lower than 9.2, follow the instructions on the PostgreSQL.org website.
  http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/interactive/upgrading.html

  When using binary packages, if you only use the client port, you can issue
  the following command to follow the default version:

  # pkg set -o databases/postgresql90-client:databases/postgresql92-client

20140528:
  AFFECTS: users of security/calife & security/calife-devel
  AUTHOR: roberto@FreeBSD.org

  Calife 2.8.x is now officially EoL.  Replace it with 3.0 (formerly
  calife-devel).

  and install security/calife.

  Change origin if you had the old one:
  # pkg set -o security/calife-devel:security/calife

20140527:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/db6
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  Oracle BerkeleyDB 6.0 was upgraded to version 6.0.30.  Databases that
  use BLOBs need to be upgraded using db_upgrade-6.0 before they can be
  accessed again. See the manual for details:

  <http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17076_03/html/api_reference/C/db_upgrade.html>

  Databases that do not use BLOBs are unaffected.

  or
  # portinstall devel/py-gobject3 devel/py-dbus

20140521:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mariadb55*
  AUTHOR: grembo@FreeBSD.org

  The mariadb55-client and mariadb55-server port have been changed to
  respect hier(7) and behave like the mysql ports. Therefore mysql-server
  and mysql monitor will refuse to start if my.cnf exists in /etc or
  /etc/mysql.

  In case you're affected, please move /etc/my.cnf to /usr/local/etc and/or
  /etc/mysql/my.cnf to /usr/local/etc/mysql.

20140520:
  AFFECTS: users of security/dropbear
  AUTHOR: ak@FreeBSD.org

  security/dropbear port separator syntax was changed (again), now using
  host^port instead of host%port.

    or
  # portupgrade -fo lang/gnu-cobol lang/open-cobol
    or
  # pkg set -o lang/open-cobol:lang/gnu-cobol

20140506:
  AFFECTS: users of ports-mgmt/portshaker
  AUTHOR: romain@FreeBSD.org

  ports-mgmt/portshaker was updated to avoid creating an aditional 'ports'
  subdirectory when merging to a poudriere_tree without ZFS, so that
  portshaker's default location matches poudriere's default location.

  Users of poudriere on non-ZFS systems should not anymore have to pass extra
  options to poudriere for it to find the ports tree.

20140506:
  AFFECTS: users of security/yassl
  AUTHOR: gahr@FreeBSD.org

  security/yassl was moved to security/cyassl to match the original package

20140428:
  AFFECTS: users of java/openjdk7
  AUTHOR: glewis@FreeBSD.org

  The previous version of openjdk7 had a bug that will prevent it from
  being able to bootstrap itself.  Please deinstall openjdk7 before
  building the new version.

20140427:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/gdal
  AUTHOR: sunpoet@FreeBSD.org

  Due to changes in header files, please deinstall gdal first while updating
  from 1.9.x/1.10.x to 1.11.x.

20140420:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba4
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  Samba4 port now re-uses the same logic and startup script as Samba41. So,
  to get net/samba4 runing you need to rename samba4_enable in /etc/rc.conf
  to the samba_sever_enable.

  samba_server_enable="YES"

  Startup script tries it's best to guess which out of samba/nmbd/smbd/winbindd
  daemons have to be started, but you can fine tune this by specifying them in
  rc.conf, just make sure that samba_server_enable is enabled(see entry for 20121022).

20140416:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/xorg graphics/dri graphics/libGL and related ports
  AUTHOR: x11@FreeBSD.org

  The default xorg version has been switched on FreeBSD 10-STABLE and
  FreeBSD 9-STABLE.

  To upgrade graphics/libGL, graphics/dri and related MESA ports, it is
  necessary to first remove the old versions of those ports.
  No special upgrade procedure is needed for xorg ports but it is
  necessary to recompile all xorg drivers (xf86-*) and other ports that
  depend on the xserver version, including
  emulators/virtualbox-ose-additions.  Portrevisions have been bumped
  where needed, but users of drivers not in the ports tree will need to
  recompile those.

  If it is important to stay on the old versions, it is possible to
  specify WITHOUT_NEW_XORG= in /etc/make.conf to get the old xorg
  distribution.

  For users in need of working console when using KMS drivers (intel and
  radeon graphics cards) please use the new vt(9) console driver.
  For more information, see https://wiki.freebsd.org/Graphics and
  https://wiki.freebsd.org/Newcons .

  To update:

  # pkg_delete -f libGL-\* dri-\*
    or
  # pkg delete -f libGL dri
    followed by
  # portmaster graphics/dri graphics/libGL
    or
  # portupgrade graphics/dri graphics/libGL
    and then
  # portmaster -a
    or
  # portupgrade -a

20140416:
  AFFECTS: users of print/freetype2 textproc/libxml2 x11/pixman
           x11/libxcb and graphics/freeglut
  AUTHOR: x11@FreeBSD.org and gnome@FreeBSD.org

  The library version of the above libraries has been brought in line
  with what upstream expects. To do this all users of these ports need
  to be rebuilt. Portrevisions have been bumped as a consequence.

  # portmaster -r freetype2 -r libxml2 -r pixman -r freeglut -r libxcb
  or
  # portupgrade -rf freetype2 libxml2 pixman freeglut libxcb

20140415:
  AFFECTS: Users of mod_python3
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  www/mod_python3 was renamed to www/mod_python33, additional www/mod_python35
  with support for apache24 was added to the portstree.

  To reflect the new port location use:

  pkgng users:
  # pkg set -o www/mod_python3:www/mod_python33

  portmaster users:
  # portmaster -o www/mod_python33 www/mod_python3

  portupgrade users:
  # portugrade -o www/mod_python33 www/mod_python3

20140414:
  AFFECTS: Users of dmd 1.X and dmd 2.x.
  AUTHOR: cy@FreeBSD.org

  lang/dmd and lang/dmd2 have switched places. Dmd 1.x is no longer supported
  by digitalmars.com and is now the secondary dmd port in the collection.
  Dmd2 is the primary port. What this means to dmd users is that dmd1 is now
  used to invoke dmd 1.x and the dmd command (instead of dmd2) now invokes
  dmd 2.x.

20140413:
  AFFECTS: Users of Python and pkg >= 1.2.7_1
  AUTHOR: koobs@FreeBSD.org

  There have been reports of the following error when upgrading Python ports:

    pkg-static: Plist error, directory listed as a file: <name>.egg-info

  The cause is an outdated or unpatched version of setuptools or distribute
  installed by the user, or leftover from previous upgrades being used during
  the `setup.py install` phase. pkg >= 1.2.7_1 now generates an error where
  previously it did not.

  Users should inspect their ${LOCALBASE}/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages
  directory, and remove any entries that reference versions of
  setuptools or distribute *not* provided by ports or packages.

  Examples of entries that may be removed are:

    1) distribute-0.6.35-py2.7.egg
    2) setuptools-0.6c11-py2.7.egg
    3) *Any* version of setuptools directly from PyPi via pip or easy_install

  More information is available here:

20140410:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/vpopmail
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  If you are storing limits in MySQL, the following schema changes must be made:

  ALTER TABLE `limits` ADD `disable_maildrop` TINYINT(1) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL AFTER `disable_spamassassin`;
  ALTER TABLE `limits` MODIFY `diskquota` BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
  ALTER TABLE `limits` MODIFY `maxmsgcount` BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
  ALTER TABLE `limits` MODIFY `defaultquota` BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
  ALTER TABLE `limits` MODIFY `defaultmaxmsgcount` BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;

20140403:
  AFFECTS: users of net/rabbitmq
  AUTHOR: olgeni@FreeBSD.org

  This release changes the behaviour of the default "guest" user.

  Previously the guest user could be accessed from any network
  location. In RabbitMQ 3.3.0 and later, the guest user can only
  be accessed via localhost by default.

  Any other users you create will not (by default) be restricted
  in this way.

  See http://www.rabbitmq.com/access-control.html for more information.

20140403:
  AFFECTS: users of net/kdnssd
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE SC ports have been updated to 4.12.4. kdnssd package has been renamed
  to match upstream naming. pkgng users need to update package origin
  manually:

  # pkg set -o net/kdnssd:net/zeroconf-ioslave

20140402:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/elasticsearch
  AUTHOR: tj@FreeBSD.org

  Elasticsearch has been updated to version 1.1.0. If you are updating
  from a version prior to 1.0.0 you will need to do a full cluster
  shutdown for this update as it can not be performed in a rolling
  fashion.

20140401:
  AFFECTS: users of security/gnutls3
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  Libdane support is no longer enabled by default.  Rebuild the port with
  the LIBDANE option if danetool is desired.

20140331:
  AFFECTS: users of print/cups-client and print/cups-image
  AUTHOR: bsam@FreeBSD.org

  CUPS ports have been updated to version 1.7.1. A file has migrated from
  cups-image port to cups-client. Before upgrading you should force the
  removal of cups-image port, otherwise it will conflict with the new one.

  pkg users:
  # pkg delete -f cups-image\*

  other users:
  # pkg_delete -f cups-image\*

  2. Install/upgrade other cups* packages.

  If cups-filters complains about a missing cups/raster.h include,
  try reinstalling the cups-client package.

20140327:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/php5 and lang/php55 with Apache module
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  The Apache PHP module has been separated from the main PHP port.
  If you had the APACHE OPTION selected, you have to perform the
  following steps:

  1) update your lang/php* options (i.e. 'make config')
  2) rebuild lang/php* port
  3) install www/mod_php* port

  It is *mandatory* to build both ports with the same DEBUG and ZTS
  options, so if you have a threaded Apache (i.e. worker or event MPM)
  you have to select the ZTS option in lang/php* port.

20140322:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/apr1
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  APR was updated to 1.5.0, BDB requirement was bumped to 48+
  It is necessary to first remove the old version of devel/apr1.

  Please rebuild all ports which are using functions from APR/APR-util
  such as Apache, Subversion, etc.

  # portmaster -r apr
    or
  # portupgrade -r devel/apr1
    or
  # pkg install -fR devel/apr1

20140318:
  AFFECTS: users of net/openldap24-server
  AUTHOR: delphij@FreeBSD.org

20140312:
  AFFECTS: users of net/openistgt
  AUTHOR: jpaetzel@FreeBSD.org

  Between istgt supporting target reload, and iscsid using CTL there is no
  point to this port.  As such it has been deleted without warning, since
  the support for it is as best questionable.

  pkgng users:

  # pkg set -o net/openistgt:net/istgt

  portmaster users:

  # portmaster -o net/istgt net/openistgt
  # portmaster -r istgt

  portupgrade users:

  # portupgrade -o net/istgt -f net/openistgt
  # portupgrade -fr net/istgt

20140310:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/p5-Mail-SpamAssassin and japanese/p5-Mail-SpamAssassin
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  The port mail/p5-Mail-SpamAssassin was renamed to mail/spamassassin and
  the port japanese/p5-Mail-SpamAssassin was renamed to japanese/spamassassin.
  To ease upgrading run the following set of commands:

  pkgng users:

  # pkg set -o mail/p5-Mail-SpamAssassin:mail/spamassassin
  # pkg set -o japanese/p5-Mail-SpamAssassin:japanese/spamassassin

  portmaster users:

  # portmaster -o mail/spamassassin mail/p5-Mail-SpamAssassin
  # portmaster -o japanese/spamassassin japanese/p5-Mail-SpamAssassin

20140307:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/py-setuptools dependent ports
  AUTHOR: sunpoet@FreeBSD.org

  devel/py-setuptools is being used for every python ports (if USE_PYDISTUTILS
  defined) since r336553. Due to PKGORIGIN limitation, we cannot build one
  python port with python27 and the other with python33 since they require
  different setuptools versions which have same PKGORIGIN. With the addition
  of py-setuptools{27,32,33}, we could now have py27-foo and py33-bar coexist
  in one system.

  Note that this is only a short-term solution. It does not help if you need
  coexistence of one port with different python versions, e.g. py27-foo and
  py33-foo.

  Please rebuild all ports that depend on devel/py-setuptools and use
  devel/py-setuptools{27,32,33} instead.

  XX represents python version (27, 32 or 33) in the following steps.

  pkgng users:

  # pkg set -o devel/py-setuptools:devel/py-setuptoolsXX

  portmaster users:

  # portmaster -o devel/py-setuptoolsXX devel/py-setuptools
  # portmaster -r py\*setuptools

  portupgrade users:

  # portupgrade -o devel/py-setuptoolsXX -f devel/py-setuptools
  # portupgrade -fr devel/py-setuptools

20140304:
  AFFECTS: users of security/kwallet
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE SC ports have been updated to 4.12.3. kwallet package has been renamed
  to match upstream naming. pkgng users need to update package origin
  manually:

  # pkg set -o security/kwallet:security/kwalletmanager

20140302:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/ansible
  AUTHOR: rm@FreeBSD.org

  This is an major update and changes were introduced in ansible 1.5, that

  will be necessary to remove it before updating.

20140220:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/vim
  AUTHOR: sunpoet@FreeBSD.org

  The editors/vim port has been reworked to simplify option handling. In UI
  option group, a new option (CONSOLE) was added for users who do not need
  GUI support. This option is off by default. You might encounter install
  or package failures with "old" option setting. Please run "make config" to
  modify your setting.

20140219:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/docbook*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The textproc/docbook-* ports have been consolidated into two ports
  textproc/docbook-sgml and textproc/docbook-xml.

  Before upgrading you should force the removal of the existing ports, they
  will conflict with the new ones.

  pkg users can run:

    pkg delete -f docbook-xml\* docbook-sk\* docbook\[2345\]\?\?-\* docbook-4\*

  the other users can run:

    pkg_delete -f docbook-xml\* docbook-sk\* docbook\[2345\]\?\?-\* docbook-4\*

20140218:
  AFFECTS: users of KDE SC 4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE SC ports have been updated to 4.12.2. kdeadmin, kdenetwork, kdesdk,
  and kdetoys ports have been split due to upstream changes.

  KDE Workspace port has been updated to 4.11.6. It requires modern
  Mesa libraries, provided by WITH_NEW_XORG knob. To update Xorg ports
  to newer version follow instructions at https://wiki.freebsd.org/Graphics

20140218:
  AFFECTS: users of misc/kdehier4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE4_PREFIX has been changed from /usr/local/kde4 to /usr/local.
  All ports that depends on kdehier4 must be reinstalled.
  PORTREVISION for affected ports has been increased, upgrading tools
  (portmaster, pkg) should handle this update without manual intervention.
  Please check /usr/local/kde4 for leftovers after upgrade. If you don't
  have locally modified files, e.g. under /usr/local/kde4/etc, you may
  safely remove /usr/local/kde4.

20140214:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.12
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  Perl 5.12 has been removed.  The default Perl is lang/perl5.16.

  pkg(8) users:
    1) Update the origin to point to 5.16:
       pkg set -o lang/perl5.12:lang/perl5.16

    2) Upgrade perl and all dependencies:
       pkg install -Rf lang/perl5.16

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
       pkgdb -Ff

    1) Reinstall new version of Perl (5.16):
       portupgrade -o lang/perl5.16 -f lang/perl5.12

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
       portupgrade -fr lang/perl5.16

  Portmaster users:
    portmaster -o lang/perl5.16 lang/perl5.12

    Conservative:
      portmaster p5-

    Comprehensive (but perhaps overkill):
      portmaster -r perl-

    Note: If the "perl-" glob matches more than one port specify the name of
      the Perl directory in /var/db/pkg explicitly.  Also, depending on when
      perl 5.12 was installed last, the prefix may be perl-, perl5- or
      perl5.12-.

20140211:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/php* database/postgresql* database/mysql* www/apache*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  If you use portupgrade:
        portupgrade -fr devel/icu
  If you use pkgng with binary packages:
        pkg install -fR devel/icu

20140201:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/zabbix*
  AUTHOR: koobs@FreeBSD.org

  The login shell for the zabbix user in UIDs was changed from
  /usr/sbin/nologin to /bin/sh to fix the zabbix-agent UserParameter
  feature.

  Please do the following according to package manager used.

  # portmaster -o www/mod_authnz_external22 www/mod_authnz_external
    or
  # portupgrade -fo www/mod_authnz_external22 www/mod_authnz_external
    or
  # pkg set -o www/mod_authnz_external:www/mod_authnz_external22

20140113:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba41
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  With the introduction of Samba 4.1 corresponding port lost SWAT support
  and made WINBIND support mandatory. As samba4 introduced additional 'samba'
  daemon to the tripplet of nmbd/smbd/winbindd to avoid confusion startup
  script for samba41 was renamed to 'samba_server'. To start the whole band
  up it's enough to add to the rc.conf:

  samba_server_enable="YES"

  Startup script tries it's best to guess which out of samba/nmbd/smbd/winbindd
  daemons have to be started, but you can fine tune this by specifying them in
  rc.conf, just make sure that samba_server_enable is enabled(see entry for 20121022).

20140112:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/libical
  AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  The libical port was updated to 1.0.0. Due to the shared library bump
  and the removal of the .la file, all ports that use libical need to be
  rebuilt.

  # portmaster -r libical
   or
  # portupgrade -fr libical
   or
  # pkg install -fR libical

20140111:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/go
  AUTHOR: jlaffaye@FreeBSD.org

  Third party Go packages installed via the ports tree are no longer installed
  in GOROOT (PREFIX/go) but in a specific path: PREFIX/share/go

  Affected ports had their PORTREVISION bumped.
  To reinstall these packages via the ports tree, it is needed to deinstall
  them first (the build will fail if the `go` command detects that they
  already exists in GOROOT).

  If you are using these third party Go packages for local Go development,
  you have to add this new path to your GOPATH environment variable.

20140107:
  AFFECTS: users of Qt 4 ports
  AUTHOR: makc@FreeBSD.org

  Qt 4 ports framework has been reworked, several ports have been renamed.

  # pkg set -o devel/qt4-declarative:x11-toolkits/qt4-declarative
  # pkg set -o devel/qt4-qtestlib:devel/qt4-testlib
  # pkg set -o textproc/qt4-clucene:textproc/clucene-qt4
  # pkg set -o www/qt4-webkit:www/webkit-qt4
  # pkg set -o x11/qt4-opengl:graphics/qt4-opengl

20140102:
  AFFECTS: users of archivers/p7zip
  AUTHOR: rakuco@FreeBSD.org

  The MINIMAL and MODULES options have been removed from archivers/p7zip,
  which now unconditionally installs the 7z, 7za and 7zr, as if the MINIMAL
  option was previously unset.

  The RAR decompression codec, whose source code has a more restrictive
  license that forbids its use for creating RAR archives, has been moved to
  a separate port, archivers/p7zip-codec-rar.

20131230:
  AFFECTS: ports using Apache Software License 2.0
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  The acronym for Apache Software License 2.0 was renamed to APACHE20

20131226:
  AFFECTS: users of security/cyrus-sasl2
  AUTHOR: ume@FreeBSD.org

  The SASL GSSAPI authentication plugin was removed from
  security/cyrus-sasl2 port and divided into new
  security/cyrus-sasl2-gssapi port.

  If you are using the SASL GSSAPI authentication, please install
  security/cyrus-sasl2-gssapi port, in addition to upgrading
  security/cyrus-sasl2 port.

20131218:
  AFFECTS: users of news/cnews
  AUTHOR: dinoex@FreeBSD.org

  The default path for overview files has changed.
  Rebuild your overview files after the update with:
  su - news /usr/local/libexec/cnews/nov/initov

20131217:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/ruby-bdb or ports-mgmt/portupgrade and databases/db5 or databases/db6
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  databases/db5 and databases/db6 have recently been updated to fix
  bugs. This changed their patchlevel version.

  However, ruby-bdb used to break during the db[56] upgrade due to a bug
  described in <http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=184921>.

  THEREFORE, YOU MUST MANUALLY UPGRADE databases/ruby-bdb INDIVIDUALLY
  TO 0.6.6_2 OR NEWER WHEN USING portupgrade AGAINST databases/db[56]
  PORTS. To achieve that, type:

  # portupgrade databases/ruby-bdb
  or
  # portmaster -x 'db*' databases/ruby-bdb

  before proceeding with other upgrades.

  Should you have corrupted the portupgrade databases, or if ruby-bdb
  refuses to work with the upgraded db* port with errors such as "DB
  needs compatible versions of libdb & db.h", then rebuild the ruby-bdb
  port manually, and fix the portupgrade databases:

  # make -C /usr/ports/databases/ruby-bdb all deinstall install clean
  # pkgdb -fu
  # portupgrade -f db5 db6

  This should return portupgrade to normal operation.

20131216:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/xorg, graphics/libGL, graphics/dri, all xorg ports
  AUTHOR: zeising@FreeBSD.org

  The default xorg version has been switched on FreeBSD CURRENT.

  To upgrade graphics/libGL, graphics/dri and related MESA ports, it is
  necessary to first remove the old versions of those ports.
  No special upgrade procedure is needed for xorg port but it is
  necessary to recompile all xorg drivers (xf86-*) and other ports that
  depend on the xserver version, including
  emulators/virtualbox-ose-additions.  Portrevisions have been bumped
  where needed, but users of drivers not in the ports tree will need to
  recompile those.

  If it is important to stay on the old versions, it is possible to
  specify WITHOUT_NEW_XORG= in /etc/make.conf to get the old xorg
  distribution.

  To update:

  # pkg_delete -f libGL-\* dri-\*
    or
  # pkg delete -f libGL dri
    followed by
  # portmaster graphics/dri graphics/libGL
    or
  # portupgrade graphics/dri graphics/libGL
    and then
  # portmaster -a
    or
  # portupgrade -a

20131216:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/db4*
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  Berkeley DB versions before and excluding 4.8 have been marked deprecated.
  New port installations should be based on Berkeley DB 5 or 6.

  Note that Oracle Berkeley DB 6 is under the more restrictive Affero GPL v3
  license, be sure to review if using that fits your requirements.

  You can add WITH_BDB_VER=5 or WITH_BDB_VER=6 to /etc/make.conf to have all
  applications that get rebuilt use Oracle Berkeley DB 5 or 6, respectively.

  DO NOT FORCE DELETE older BerkeleyDB packages, that breaks the upgrade
  tools.  Instead, first rebuild the ports that depend on it, then
  remove the old Berkeley DB versions.

  Berkeley DB ports should be able to build/install with an older and a
  newer version version both installed if WITH_BDB_VER is set.  If a
  port then grabs the old Berkeley DB version, that is an issue with the
  port that requires Berkeley DB, and should be reported to the
  maintainer.

  If you are interested in upgrading now already, we have instructions
  at <https://wiki.freebsd.org/Ports/BerkeleyDBCleanup>.

  AFFECTS: users of graphics/opencv, graphics/opencv-core
  AUTHOR: jhale@FreeBSD.org

  OpenCV has been updated to 2.4.7.  Due to movement of files between the
  opencv port and the opencv-core port, it will be necessary to remove
  both packages before updating.

  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.12 lang/perl5.14 lang/perl5.16 and lang/perl5.18
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The THREADS option has been enabled by default in all Perl. If you're using
  binary packages you need to do :

    # pkg install -Rf perl5

  If you're not using binary packages, and want to switch from non threaded
  Perl to threaded Perl, you need to recompile and reinstall most ports
  depending on Perl. Supposing you have Perl 5.16, you would do:

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
	pkgdb -Ff

    1) Change the option in lang/perl5.16:
        make -C /usr/ports/lang/perl5.16 config

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
	portupgrade -fr lang/perl5.16

  Portmaster users:
    1) Change the option in lang/perl5.16:
        make -C /usr/ports/lang/perl5.16 config

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
	portmaster -r perl5-

  Note: The installed Perl package was named perl and is now named perl5, if
	you have not updated your installation in a long time, you may need to
	use "perl-" here.

20131112:
  AFFECTS: users of dns/nsd
  AUTHOR: erwin@FreeBSD.org

  dns/nsd was updated to the new 4.0.0 major release.

  This version replaces the nsdc control program with nsd-control.
  This requires some manual setup with nsd-control-setup and editing
  of the config files. nsd-control is incompatible with nsdc so when
  that is used in scripts, these should be adapted.  More information:
  http://www.nlnetlabs.nl/svn/nsd/tags/NSD_4_0_0_REL/doc/NSD-4-features

  NSD version 3 is still supported in dns/nsd3.  To keep the old
  version:
  # portmaster -o dns/nsd3 dns/nsd
    or
  # portupgrade -fo dns/nsd3 dns/nsd
    or
  # pkg set -o dns/nsd:dns/nsd3

20131112:
  AFFECTS: users of dns/bind9*
  AUTHOR: erwin@FreeBSD.org

  All bind9 ports have been updated to support FreeBSD 10.x after
  BIND was removed from the base system.  It is now self-contained
  in ${PREFIX}/etc/namedb, and chroot and symlinking options are
  no longer supported out of the box.

  For users of FreeBSD 9.x and earlier, the LINKS option is no longer
  enabled by default, but still supported.  No other changes should
  affect those users, and updating without changing already set options
  will keep the system in the same state.

20131103:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libtasn1 and any port that depends on it
  AUTHOR: novel@FreeBSD.org

  # portupgrade -fr security/libtasn1
    or
  # pkg install -fR security/libtasn1

20131031:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/rtmpdump
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The library part of multimedia/rtmpdump is split into multimedia/librtmp.
  multimedia/rtmpdump now depends on the library port.

  A build error can occur if you built and installed old rtmpdump by
  using stock OpenSSL, and then install security/openssl and try to build
  multimedia/rtmpdump without deinstalling the installed one.  Please
  make sure if the old rtmpdump is removed before building the new version.

  installed the same line as for ekiga3 can be used except without the 3 at
  the end.

  # portmaster -o devel/ptlib devel/ptlib26
  # portmaster -o net/opal net/opal3
  # portmaster -o net/ekiga3 net-im/ekiga
    or
  # portupgrade -fo devel/ptlib devel/ptlib26
  # portupgrade -fo net/opal net/opal3
  # portupgrade -fo net/ekiga3 net-im/ekiga
    or
  # pkg set -o devel/ptlib26 devel/ptlib
  # pkg set -o net/opal3 net/opal
  # pkg set -o net/ekiga3 net-im/ekiga

  AFFECTS: Users of ports
  AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  New way to override the default version of a language in the ports
  tree.

  The make variable, DEFAULT_VERSIONS, allows users to override the
  default version defined by the ports tree.

  For example, to declare specific versions for Perl, Ruby and Tcl/Tk,
  it would be defined as:

	DEFAULT_VERSIONS=	perl5=5.18 ruby=2.0 tcltk=8.6

  Today, this only is supported by Perl, Ruby, and Tcl/Tk.

  AFFECTS: Users of ports
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  Optional Stack Protector [1] support has been added with the WITH_SSP_PORTS
  knob.

  WITH_SSP_PORTS=	yes

  This currently is only supported on FreeBSD 10 amd64/i386 and earlier
  releases on amd64.

  The default SSP_CLFAGS is -fstack-protector, but -fstack-protector-all
  may optionally be set instead.

  To enable support, add WITH_SSP_PORTS=yes to your make.conf and rebuild all
  ports.

  # portmaster -af
    or
  # portupgrade -af

  AFFECTS: 10-CURRENT users with any port depending on converters/libiconv
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  10-CURRENT after r254273 (committed on August 13, 2013) has an
  implementation of iconv enabled by default in libc.

  NOTE: after r341775 (committed on January 29, 2014) and other
  following commits, a few ports, including devel/glib20, depend
  on the converters/libiconv again due to missing functionality in the
  base iconv implementation.

  Due to this change some major overhauling of the ports tree has
  been necessary to move the ports to using that implementation.

  People using pkgng binary packages should have little problems,
  "pkg upgrade" will update all software to not depend on libiconv
  anymore, once updated packages are available. Please make sure to
  perform a "pkg autoremove" after that and check that libiconv is
  correctly removed by it.

  If you are using ports the update requires some manual intervention.
  The following procedure should be followed:

  # pkg query %ro libiconv >ports_to_update
  # pkg delete -f libiconv
  # cat ports_to_update | xargs portmaster

  or:

  # pkg query %ro libiconv >ports_to_update
  # pkg delete -f libiconv
  # cat ports_to_update | xargs portupgrade -f

  AFFECTS: users of graphics/gdal
  AUTHOR: sunpoet@FreeBSD.org

  Due to changes in header files, please deinstall gdal first while updating
  from 1.9.x to 1.10.x.

  AFFECTS: users of mail/meta1
  AUTHOR: dinoex@FreeBSD.org

  The on disk format has changed.
  Please make sure that queue is empty before you update.

20130817:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/python*
  AUTHOR: mva@FreeBSD.org

  The lang/python* ports do not install links to 2to3, idle, pydoc, python
  and other binaries anymore. Those were moved into the lang/python2 and
  lang/python3 ports respectively. This change brings us closer to the goal
  of making Python ports usable with different Python versions at the same
  time.

  If you have lang/python2* or lang/python3* installed, please also install
  the associated lang/python2 or lang/python3 port.

  1. update lang/python2* and/or lang/python3*
  2. install lang/python2 and/or lang/python3
  3. install/update lang/python

20130816:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/opendx and math/octave-forge-octcdf
  AUTHOR: stephen@FreeBSD.org

  These two ports have changed the science/netcdf dependency to
  science/netcdf4.  It is recommended that the science/netcdf package
  be deinstalled before rebuilding these ports, otherwise you are likely
  to face port conflicts when building future ports.

20130806:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/eric4
  AUTHOR: bsam@FreeBSD.org

  Since PKGVERSION=4.5.13_1 the default file destination has changed from
  ${PYTHON_SITELIBDIR}/eric4 to ${DATADIR}.

20130731:
  AFFECTS: users of glib20
  AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  The devel/gio-fam-backend port was removed in the glib 2.36 update.
  Since the gio-fam-backend port was used in USE_GNOME=glib20, all
  dependencies need to be rebuilt. The removal of gio-fam-backend isn't
  critical, glib20 using programs should work just fine if the port is still
  installed. It is not clear however, if glib20 will use the new kqueue
  backend or the old fam backend.

  Note that users of pkg packages can just run the pkg delete command after
  their next update.

  # portmaster -r gio-fam-backend
  # pkg_delete gio-fam-backend-\* (for pkgng: pkg delete gio-fam-backend)
  # portmaster -a

    or

  # portupgrade -rf gio-fam-backend
  # pkg_delete gio-fam-backend-\* (for pkgng: pkg delete gio-fam-backend)
  # portupgrade -a

20130726:
  AFFECTS: users of Qt 3 and KDE 3
  AUTHOR: rene@FreeBSD.org

  All ports based on Qt 3 (including KDE 3 but also ports which used Qt 3
  as a graphical toolkit) expired on 20130701 because Qt 3 and KDE 3 were
  no longer maintained upstream.  These ports have been removed today.

  Users of KDE 3 are advised to switch to another desktop environment
  provided in the Ports Collection, e.g. KDE 4 or Xfce.

  Users of Qt 3 are advised to upgrade to the Qt 4 counterpart(s).

  AFFECTS: users of net/openafs
  AUTHOR: bjk@FreeBSD.org

  The OpenAFS 1.6.5 release is a security release which requires substantial
  configuration changes to the AFS servers in addition to the software update,
  in order to be fully protected.  The entry for OPENAFS-SA-2013-003 on
  http://www.openafs.org/security/ has links to the upgrade documentation.
  The procedure involves rekeying the cell to a non-DES krb5 key, stored in
  a krb5 keytab named rxkad.keytab in PREFIX/etc/openafs/server/.

20130720:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/mozc-server and japanese/mozc-el
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The bin/mozc_emacs_helper program is now built and installed by
  japanese/mozc-server because the build processes are heavily
  overlapped with each other and the helper program does not depend on
  most of what mozc-server does actually.  To upgrade them, please remove
  mozc-el first to prevent a conflict with the installed bin/mozc_emacs_helper.

20130719:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/bacula-server, sysutils/bacula-client, sysutils/bacula-bat
  AUTHOR: dvl@FreeBSD.org

  The configuration files for bacula have been moved to PREFIX/etc/bacula.
  Move your existing configuration files to this directory after
  upgrading.

20130718:
  AFFECTS: users of security/logcheck
  AUTHOR: glarkin@FreeBSD.org

  The logcheck port now provides a configuration option controlling
  installation of the crontab file. When installing the port interactively,
  the port option is enabled by default to mimic previous behavior.

  When the port is installed non-interactively (BATCH=yes) the crontab
  file *will not* be installed automatically. If the EXAMPLES port option
  is enabled, the crontab file can be installed manually at a later time
  from EXAMPLESDIR/crontab.in.

20130718:
  AFFECTS: users of www/zend-framework
  AUTHOR: wg@FreeBSD.org

  zend-framework has been updated to 2.2.1 and old 1.12.0 has been copied
  to www/zend-framework1. If you wish to stay with the older version run:

  # portmaster -o www/zend-framework1 www/zend-framework
    or
  # portupgrade -fo www/zend-framework1 www/zend-framework
    or
  # pkg set -o www/zend-framework:www/zend-framework1

20130714:
  AFFECTS: users of net/avahi-gtk
  AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  Avahi was updated to 0.6.31, due to changes in the avahi-gtk port it will
  be necessary to remove the avahi-gtk port before updating.
  Users of pkg packages can skip this step.

  # pkg_delete -f avahi-gtk\*
    or
  # pkg delete -f avahi-gtk
    followed by
  # portmaster net/avahi-gtk
    or
  # portupgrade net/avahi-gtk
