This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when upgrading
your ports.  We try our best to minimize these disruptions, but sometimes
they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each time
you update your ports collection, before attempting any port upgrades.

20231229:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/tarantool
  AUTHOR: arrowd@FreeBSD.org

  A new major version of the tarantool has been released.

  databases/tarantool renamed to databases/tarantool2.

  2.11 is an LTS version and will be supported for a while.

20231125:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/php81
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of PHP has been switched from 8.1 to 8.2.

  If you use binary packages you should make a list of php packages
  before running 'pkg upgrade':

  # pkg info \*php81\* > ~/installed-php-ports-list

  After the upgrade, check with such list if all your php extensions
  are still installed, and reinstall them if needed.

  If you use mod_php81 you need to deinstall it and install mod_php82.

20231104:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to the latest stable version 3.8 of LibreSSL.
  The shared library versions of the libraries have been bumped.

  After upgrading, manually update all packages that depend on any of the
  libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and libtls) since the
  versions of these libraries have changed. Normally, you can obtain the
  list of dependent software by running the following command:

  # pkg info -r libressl

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies.

20231031:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/subversion-lts
  AUTHOR: michaelo@FreeBSD.org

  devel/subversion-lts has been updated from 1.10.x to the latest LTS version,
  1.14.x. Some changes between these releases may require attention from
  administrators or users.
  Refer to https://subversion.apache.org/docs/release-notes/1.14.html#compat-misc for details.

20231028:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/nfdump

  nfdump-1.7.x is compatible to nfdump-1.6.18, which means it can
  read files created with nfdump-1.6.18 or newer. Flow files created
  with earlier nfdump versions may not contain all flow elements.
  If you have older files, it is recommended to use nfdump-1.6.17
  to update the records.

  nfdump 1.7.x provides the same set of programs as 1.6.x and can
  be used almost as a drop-in replacement. This may change in future
  and older legacy programs may be removed. You can convert any old
  files from nfdump-1.6 to nfdump-1.7 format by reading/writing
  files: ./nfdump -r old-flowfile -y -w new-flowfile

  Please note, that only nfdump may read older flow files. All other
  programs relay on the new file format.

20231027:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/librenms
  AUTHOR: dvl@FreeBSD.org

  When updating to >= 23.10.0, a broken crontab is fixed. This breakage
  caused the validation error: Scheduler is not running
  After updating, If that error does not clear for you, run:

    sudo lnms config:cache

20231027:
  AFFECTS: users of print/ghostscript9*
  AUTHOR: michaelo@FreeBSD.org

  The default ghostscript version has been updated from 9 to 10.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 9 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ghostscript 9 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ghostscript=9

  Please note that print/ghostcript9* will be removed in the future since it is
  not supported by upstream anymore.

20231026:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/chicken
  AUTHOR: gahr@FreeBSD.org

  The chicken binaries csc and csi, together with their manual pages, have been
  renamed to chicken-csc and chicken-csi, to avoid conflicts with lang/mono.
  This is in line with what several Linux distros do. See PR 274736.

20231023:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/mailman3
  AUTHOR: einar@isnic.is

  logging.http section has now been split into two parts, logging.http is for
  the Mailman internal code and logging.gunicorn is for Gunicorn specifically
  since they have different logging formats. This should fix spurious errors
  with KeyError: t that was often confusing for users.

  Python 3.9 is now the minimum supported version of Python.

20231017:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5*
  AUTHOR: delphij@FreeBSD.org

  The default Perl version has been switched to Perl 5.36.  If you are using
  binary packages to upgrade your system, you do not have anything to do, pkg
  upgrade will do the right thing.

20231014:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openssl and security/openssl30
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The openssl port was renamed to openssl111 and subsequently the
  openssl30 port was renamed to openssl.

  The shared library version of OpenSSL has been bumped.

  Users of DEFAULT_VERSIONS= ssl=openssl30 must update this to
  ssl=openssl.
  Users of DEFAULT_VERSIONS= ssl=openssl should not change this unless
  they use ports that require the deprecated OpenSSL 1.1.1 version.

  You must rebuild all ports that depend on OpenSSL if you use OpenSSL
  from ports.

20231011:
  AFFECTS: users of www/caddy
  AUTHOR:  adamw@FreeBSD.org

  The default admin endpoint has changed from localhost:2019 to
  /var/run/caddy/caddy.sock. Using a Unix socket is more secure,
  allowing it to be secured by filesystem permissions rather than
  requiring a firewall.

  If you only control caddy from the rc(8) script (service caddy ...),
  you don't need to do anything. If you access the API yourself, you
  will want to update your scripts to use the new socket.

  To use the old endpoint, add the following to /etc/rc.conf:

    caddy_admin="localhost:2019"

20231009:
  AFFECTS: users of net/ntpd-rs
  AUTHOR: mikael@freebsd.org

  In 1.0.0 the configuration has been completely reworked, please check the
  documentation for details. Configuration will not automatically migrate.

20231004:
  AFFECTS: www/gitlab-ce
  AUTHOR:  mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  Before you upgrade to version 16.4.x or higher, make sure you did the
  upgrade to 16.3.x!

  The database migration for 16.4.1 can fail due to unexpected name of a foreign key.
  So it is recommended to have a database backup available in case the solution
  described in the update manual does not work for you.

  The upgrade manual can be found as usual here:
  https://gitlab.fechner.net/mfechner/Gitlab-docu/-/blob/master/update/16.3-16.4-freebsd.md


20230930:
  AFFECTS: users of Transmission (net-p2p/transmission@*)
  AUTHOR:  mondo.debater_0q@icloud.com

  Fixes Bug 274065 by reorganizing the port as a metaport
  (net-p2p/transmission) and components port (net-p2p/transmission-components).
  Each component may be installed through the flavors of
  transmission-componenents (@cli, @daemon, @docs, @gtk, @qt, @utils).
  Alternatively, one or more component may be installed by running make config
  on the metaport net-p2p/transmission.

  AFFECTS: users of devel/php-composer2
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  The composer2 ports has been moved over the old devel/php-composer
  port, which was still providing the old EOLed version 1 of the
  software.

  Please use `pkg install php81-composer` (substitute 81 with the
  PHP version you're using) to properly upgrade.

20230924:
  AFFECTS: users of XFCE desktop (x11-wm/xfce4)
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  XFCE 4.18 is incompatible with the latest version of the adwaita
  icon theme (version 42.0 and newer), which was used as the default one.
  Due to this the default icon theme has been changed to
  x11-themes/xfce-icons-elementary.

  Users that have XFCE already installed and are using the adwaita
  icon theme will notice missing icons. To fix this you can install
  any other icon theme (like x11-themes/xfce-icons-elementary) and
  configure XFCE to use that via the "appearance" settings application,
  under the "icons" tab.

20230919:
  AFFECTS: users of net-p2p/transmission
  AUTHOR:  mondo.debater_0q@icloud.com

  The 4.0 port haphazardly consolidated prior slave ports into flavors of a single port.
  The flavors have now been revised to better match releases prior to 4.0.
  The -full flavor included in the 4.0 port has been replaced with -default, which
  restores the compile-time options of prior release's metaport. Other flavors allow
  for more piecemeal installs. The prior -web slave port can be installed through the
  -default flavor or the -daemon flavor.

  See Bug 273841 for more details.

20230915:
  AFFECTS: users of print/ghostscript10
  AUTHOR: michael.osipov@siemens.com

  The port flavors have been replaced with a default port option of X11.
  The flavors approach creates conflicting dependencies with other ports which
  cannot be solved this time with the ports framework.

  See PRs 270989 and 272541 for details.

20230910:
  AFFECTS: users of dns/powerdns
  AUTHOR: tremere@cainites.net

  In Authoritative Server 4.8, the LMDB backend gains a new Lightning
  Stream-compatible schema, which requires a data migration (this is
  automatic, and there is no migration back to the old schema). LMDB
  backend users should pay extra attention to the Upgrade Notes
  (https://doc.powerdns.com/authoritative/upgrading.html).

20230910:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netbox
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  1. Please make sure that the PostgreSQL server for the NetBox instance is
     running version 12 or higher.  This is because Django 4.2 requires
     PostgreSQL 12 as a minimum.

  2. Please also check the pkg-message and the changelogs for further info.

20230908:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql* and other software using PostgreSQL to run
  AUTHOR: kbowling@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of PostgreSQL has been switched from 13 to 15.
  The upgrade procedure can use up twice the space the databases
  currently needs. If you have a big amount of stored data take a
  closer look at the manpage of pg_upgrade for avoidance and/or
  speedup of the upgrade.

  The upgrade instructions consider a basic usage and do not match
  complex scenarios like replication, sharding, or similar.

  Upgrade instructions:

  First stop your PostgreSQL, create PostgreSQL-binaries and backup your data.
  If you have another Version of PostgreSQL installed, for example 13, your
  files are named according to this.

  # service postgresql stop
  # pkg create postgresql13-server postgresql13-contrib
  # mkdir /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # tar xf postgresql13-server-13.12.pkg -C /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # tar xf postgresql13-contrib-13.12.pkg -C /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # pkg delete -f databases/postgresql13-server databases/postgresql13-contrib databases/postgresql13-client

  Now update PostgreSQL:

    pkg user:
    # pkg install databases/postgresql15-server databases/postgresql15-contrib
    # pkg upgrade

    Portmaster users:
    # portmaster databases/postgresql15-server databases/postgresql15-contrib
    # portmaster -a

    Portupgrade users:
    # portinstall databases/postgresql15-server databases/postgresql15-contrib
    # portupgrade -a

  After installing the new PostgreSQL version you need to convert
  all your databases to new version:

  # su -l postgres -c "/usr/local/bin/initdb --encoding=utf-8 --lc-collate=C -D /var/db/postgres/data15 -U postgres"
  # su -l postgres -c "pg_upgrade -b /tmp/pg-upgrade/usr/local/bin/ -d /var/db/postgres/data13/ -B /usr/local/bin/ -D /var/db/postgres/data15/ -U postgres "

  Now the migration is finished. You can start PostgreSQL again with:

  # service postgresql start

  ATTENTION:
  1) The default user changed from "pgsql" to "postgres" in 11. The migration steps above now assume
     the "postgres" database user and FreeBSD user.
  2) See the updating entry 20190829 if you are updating from a release prior to 11.
  3) If you use non-default initdb options, you have to adjust the initdb-command accordingly

20230906:
  AUTHOR: jrm@FreeBSD.org
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/devcpu-data*

  The CPU microcode ports have been reorganized.  The new ports are:
  sysutils/cpu-microcode, sysutils/cpu-microcode-amd,
  sysutils/cpu-microcode-intel, and cpu-microcode-rc.

  To install all CPU microcode packages:

     pkg install cpu-microcode

  To install only packages for a specific CPU vendor:

     pkg install cpu-microcode-amd

     or

     pkg install cpu-microcode-intel

  To give users time to adjust to these changes, sysutils/devcpu-data will
  remain in the tree until the end of 2023.  The port has been converted to a
  metaport and now provides the same functionality as sysutils/cpu-microcode.

  Refer to the commit log in bc7829212d153aeff69b439d08e2e3001ef88ba3 for an
  explanation as to why these changes were made.

20230904:
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org
  AFFECTS: users of misc/openhab

  The rc.d script of 4.0.2 had an error which didn't take the user to
  run openhab into account. After installing the update and stopping
  openhab run (for the default settings)
    chown -R openhab:openhab /var/db/openhab/userdata /var/log/openhab
  If you use other directories for the userdata and logs, you need to
  adapt accordingly.

20230822:
  AUTHOR: arrowd@FreeBSD.org
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/polkit together with sysutils/consolekit2

  ConsoleKit2 has grown some logind1 compatibility which resulted in breaking
  changes in its API. One of its consumers, Polkit, is patched to handle it,
  so make sure to update both ports simultaneously.

20230822:
  AUTHOR: leres@FreeBSD.org
  AFFECTS: users of security/zeek

  Zeek has been upgraded to 6.0.0 and the NETMAP option was removed;
  it was too difficult to build it without zeek being installed in
  %%PREFIX%%.

  The consensus was that this was a rarely used feature, please
  reach out to me if need this (I've done some work on a new
  security/zeek-netmap port that is probably the right way forward).

  When I upgraded zeek on my systems I found some cruft left over
  from previous versions. The way I recommend upgrading from 5.0.9 to
  6.0.0 is:

      service zeek stop
      pkg delete -fy zeek py311-zkg
      [clean up leftover files in /usr/local/lib/zeek]
      pkg install -y zeek
      service zeek deploy

20230817:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/redis
  AUTHOR: yasu@FreeBSD.org

  The databases/redis port has been updated to 7.2. Users wanting to
  stay on 7.0 can replace databases/redis with databases/redis70 with
  one of the following commands.

  If you use pkg with binary packages:
    # pkg set -o databases/redis:databases/redis70
    # pkg upgrade
  If you use portmaster:
    # portmaster -o databases/redis70 databases/redis
  If you use portupgrade:
    # portupgrade -o databases/redis70 databases/redis

20230814:
  AFFECTS: usrs of www/kdsoap
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  The port www/kdsoap has been flavorized to support both Qt5 and Qt6.
  For symmetry, the Qt5 package has been renamed to kdsoap-qt5.

20230811:
  AFFECTS: users of www/p5-AnyEvent-WebSocket-Client
  AUTHOR: rodrigo@FreeBSD.org

  The update to AnyEvent-WebSocket-Client 0.55 introduce a change in behavior:
  close() default return code is now 1000 instead of 1005

20230730:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5*
  AUTHOR: delphij@FreeBSD.org

  The default Perl version has been switched to Perl 5.34.  If you are using
  binary packages to upgrade your system, you do not have anything to do, pkg
  upgrade will do the right thing.

20230726:
  AFFECTS: users of misc/openhab
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  The update to openhab 4.0.0 may require changes to the running 3.x setup.
  Read the release notes at
    https://github.com/openhab/openhab-distro/releases/tag/4.0.0
  and the blog entry at
    https://www.openhab.org/blog/2023-07-23-openhab-4-0-release.html
  for manual changes which are required before updating the port.

  After the update the pkg-message provides some more info about manual
  changes which are required to perform before the first start of 4.0.0.

  Note, this includes a switch from java 11 to java 17. You can deinstall
  openjdk11 afterwards, if it is not needed for something else.

20230723:
  AFFECTS: users of security/py-cryptography
  AUTHOR: tcberner@FreeBSD.org

  Modern py-cryptography uses rust. In order to still support the Tier-2
  architectures without rust support, a new default-version was added:
     PYCRYPTOGRAPHY
  it allows for the values 'rust' and 'legacy'.
  The default is 'rust' on all platforms supporting this.
  Note: users that are relying on the 'legacy' version will also take care
  of using a non-base OpenSSL in the future.

20230620:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/elixir-devel
  AUTHOR: dch@FreeBSD.org

	Note that Elixir now *requires* OTP25+ or better at runtime.
	For the -devel flavour you are still free to choose OTP25 or
	OTP26, but the default OTP24 from lang/erlang will *not* work.

20230618:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/soft-serve
  AUTHOR: ashish@FreeBSD.org

  soft-serve no longer uses config repository for configuration. To migrate
  configuration from 0.4.x to 0.5.x, please review the upgrade documentation at:

      https://github.com/charmbracelet/soft-serve/releases/tag/v0.5.0

  The migration process has been incorporated in rc.d script's migrate command,
  and can be performed using following instructions:

  0. Please make sure to backup repository data

  1. Stop existing process:

      # /usr/local/etc/rc.d/soft-serve stop

  2. Run the rc.d script to migrate, e.g.

      # /usr/local/etc/rc.d/soft-serve migrate
      INFO Setting SSH listen address...
      INFO Copying SSH host key...
      INFO Reading config repository...
      INFO Setting server settings...
      INFO Copying repos...
      INFO   Copying repo ports
      INFO   Copying readme from "config" to ".soft-serve"
      INFO Setting repos metadata & collabs...
      INFO Creating users & collabs...
      INFO Creating user "ashish"
      INFO Writing config...
      INFO Done!

  Another variable is introduced in rc.d script, soft_serve_data_path,
  indicating the path to data directory used by soft-serve.

20230618:
  AFFECTS: textproc/apache-solr*
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  Apache solr is upgraded to version 9.
  Data migration is required, examples for dovecot data can be found here:
  https://dovecot.org/pipermail/dovecot/2022-May/124701.html
  https://dovecot.org/pipermail/dovecot/2022-May/124711.html

  If you like to stay on version8:
  # pkg delete apache-solr
  # pkg install apache-solr8

20230609:
  AFFECTS: users of security/sequoia
  AUTHOR: vishwin@FreeBSD.org

  sq has been split to security/sequoia-sq; security/sequoia becomes
  a meta-port, where security/sequoia-sq is currently the only
  dependency. As other programs are individually ported over, they
  will become OPTIONS in the meta-port.

  Per upstream, FFI is deprecated in favour of point solutions.

20230602:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netbox
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  1. If the plugin security/py-netbox-secretstore is used, which is no
     longer maintained by upstream, the following steps must be done before
     upgrading to NetBox 3.5:

     * Migrate from security/py-netbox-secretstore (= 1.4.2_2) to
       security/py-netbox-secrets (= 1.7.6) with a NetBox 3.4.x instance.

       It is very important that the versions of py-netbox-secretstore and
       py-netbox-secrets match as specified otherwise the migration will not
       be successful.

       The reason for this is that py-netbox-secrets 1.8.x is not backwards
       compatible with Netbox 3.4.  For further details please see the
       updating instructions of py-netbox-secretstore or the UPDATING entry
       of 2023-05-11.

  2. Please also check the pkg-message and the changelogs for further info.

20230531:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netdisco
  AUTHOR: dgeo@centrale-marseille.fr

  The netdisco user now needs a HOME and a shell.
  For existing installs you will need to set
  HOME to /usr/local/etc/netdisco and shell to /bin/sh.

  For example in one shell line:
  pw user mod netdisco -d /usr/local/etc/netdisco -s /bin/sh

20230526:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/exim
  AUTHOR: pi@FreeBSD.org

  The port changes from USE_DB to USE_NDBM. Any existing configuration like
  ${lookup{$needle}dbm{haystack.db}}
  will need to change to
  ${lookup{$needle}dbm{haystack}}.

  Please also rename your old DBM files while the exim daemon is stopped:
  find /var/spool/exim/db/* -not -name \*.lockfile -exec mv -i {} {}.db \;

20230513:
  AFFECTS: users of www/tt-rss
  AUTHOR: dereks@lifeofadishwasher.com

  www/tt-rss now expects the user to install the database drivers by hand
  allowing the port to be database independent however it would be best if you
  mark the php driver packages as a non-automatic package such that
  pkg-autoremove doesn't uninstall them.

  Change 80 to your corresponding php version (80, 81, 82)

  mysql: pkg set -yA 0 php80-mysqli php80-pdo_mysql;
  pgsql: pkg set -yA 0 php80-pgsql php80-pdo_pgsql;

20230511:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/py-netbox-secretstore
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  Upstream no longer maintains py-netbox-secretstore which it is not
  compatible with NetBox 3.5 or newer.  To ensure compatibility with newer
  releases of NetBox, the py-netbox-secrets plugin should be used instead.

  To migrate from security/py-netbox-secretstore to
  security/py-netbox-secrets please do following steps:

   1. Make a backup.

   2. Install security/py-netbox-secrets

   3. Enable both plugins by updating the following line in the netbox
      configuration (e.g. /usr/local/share/netbox/netbox/configuration.py):

      PLUGINS = ['netbox_secretstore', 'netbox_secrets']

   4. Run NetBox migrations:

      # cd /usr/local/share/netbox
      # python3.9 manage.py migrate

   5. Re-adjust the indices for the netbox-secrets plugin:

      # python3.9 manage.py sqlsequencereset netbox_secrets > output.sql

   6. Run the output of the previous command in the database, e.g.:

      # psql -d NETBOXDB < output.sql

   7. You can now remove netbox-secretstore from the application by removing
      it from the PLUGINS line in the netbox configuration:

      PLUGINS = ['netbox_secrets']

   8. Collect static files of the netbox-secrets plugin:

      # python3.9 manage.py collectstatic --no-input

   9. Restart WSGI/httpd environment (supervisord/apache/nginx/etc.).

  10. You may have clean up your database of the old tables manually, e.g.:

      DROP TABLE netbox_secretstore_secret;
      DROP TABLE netbox_secretstore_secretrole;
      DROP TABLE netbox_secretstore_sessionkey;
      DROP TABLE netbox_secretstore_userkey;

  11. Uninstall security/py-netbox-secretstore.

20230505:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/mutt
  AUTHOR: dereks@lifeofadishwasher.com

  The patches included in the mail/mutt port will be removed in approximately a
  month making the port more inline with upstream. If you require any of these
  features most are available in mail/neomutt or it's possible to use
  EXTRA_PATCH_TREE to patch a port when building locally.

20230504:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/py-mqttwarn
  AUTHOR: dvl@FreeBSD.org

  The redis option REISPUB has been renamed to REDISPUB
  You should update any make.conf setting etc which refer to this.
  e.g. change sysutils_py-mqttwarn_REISPUB to sysutils_py-mqttwarn_REDISPUB
