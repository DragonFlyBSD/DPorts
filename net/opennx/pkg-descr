OpenNX is an open source drop in replacement for NoMachine's NX client. It is
compatible to the original client in that it uses the same syntax for the
session configuration files (.nxs files). OpenNX is distributed under the GNU
Lesser Public License v2.1. OpenNX is written in C++ and uses the excellent
wxWidgets toolkit. Compared to the original client, it also adds some
additional features which improve usability:

    - Ability to use the OpenSC framework to enable SmartCard based
    authentication for the initial SSH connection.

    - Ability to use a variety of different proxy types.

    - Ability to fetch session configuration files via http (read only)

    - Ability to disable configuration controls by providing a read only
    configuration file.

    - Dynamic use of libsmbclient, libcups, libopensc and pulseaudio (no static
    dependencies).

    - Uses libjpeg-turbo for speed improvement (if available).
