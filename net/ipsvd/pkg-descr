ipsvd is a set of internet protocol service daemons.
It currently includes a TCP/IP service daemon, and a UDP/IP service daemon.

An internet protocol service (ipsv) daemon waits for incoming connections
on a local socket. On incoming connections, the ipsv daemon conditionally
runs an arbitrary program with standard input reading from the socket, and
standard output writing to the socket, that handles the connection.
Standard error is used for logging.

ipsv daemons can be told to read and follow pre-defined instructions on
how to handle incoming connections. It's possible to run different
programs, or to set a different environment, or to deny a connection, or
to set a per host concurrency limit, depending on the client's address or
hostname.

Normally the ipsv daemons are run by a supervisor process, such as runsv
from the runit package, or supervise from the daemontools package.

ipsvd can be used to run services normally run by inetd, xinetd, or tcpserver.
