The OpenSSL Project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,
commercial-grade, full-featured, and Open Source toolkit implementing
the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1,
v1.1, v1.2, v1.3) protocols with full-strength cryptography world-wide.
The project is managed by a worldwide community of volunteers that use
the Internet to communicate, plan, and develop the OpenSSL tookit
and its related documentation.
