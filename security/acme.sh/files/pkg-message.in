{ type: install
  message: <<EOM
This script will create the following directories if they do not exist:

 ~acme/.acme.sh
 ~acme/certs

The script will also install ~acme/.acme.sh/account.conf.sample which has
sane defaults.  Copy this to ~acme/.acme.sh/account.conf and edit contents
to suit.

If you have EXAMPLES on:

* In the %%EXAMPLESDIR%% directory, you can find the dnsapi 
  scripts which will be useful if you decide to use dns-01 challenges. Also 
  included are the deploy scripts.

* A newsyslog.conf sample file is installed at 
  %%PREFIX%%/etc/newsyslog.d/acme.sh - you must modify it by
  at least uncommenting the line.

* If you run `newsyslog -NC` it will create the required logfiles.

* Please edit %%PREFIX%%/etc/cron.d/acme.sh - directions are provided in that
  file.
