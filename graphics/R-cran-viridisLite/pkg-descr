Implementation of the 'viridis' - the default -, 'magma', 'plasma',
'inferno', and 'cividis' color maps for 'R'. 'viridis', 'magma',
'plasma', and 'inferno' are ported from 'matplotlib'
<http://matplotlib.org/>, a popular plotting library for 'python'.
'cividis', was developed by Jamie R. Nu√±ez and Sean M. Colby. These
color maps are designed in such a way that they will analytically
be perfectly perceptually-uniform, both in regular form and also
when converted to black-and-white. They are also designed to be
perceived by readers with the most common form of color blindness
(all color maps in this package) and color vision deficiency
('cividis' only). This is the 'lite' version of the more complete
'viridis' package that can be found at
<https://cran.r-project.org/package=viridis>.
