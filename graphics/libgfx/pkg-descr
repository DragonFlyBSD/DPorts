The purpose of this library is to simplify the creation of computer graphics
software. Specifically, it is targeted towards cross-platform development
using the OpenGL rendering API and the FLTK interface toolkit. It attempts
to provide facilities which are useful in the majority of graphics programs.

This release introduces some (relatively small) incompatible changes with
1.0.x versions of the library. Details on changes can be found below.
