Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents
almost all crashes, and eliminates data races. Some of its features:

  - Zero-cost abstractions
  - Move semantics
  - Guaranteed memory safety
  - Threads without data races
  - Trait-based generics
  - Pattern matching
  - Type inference
  - Minimal runtime
  - Efficient C binding

Rust is currently work-in-progress.  Its development is driven by Mozilla
with help of a large open source community.
