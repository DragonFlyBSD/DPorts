The libutempter library provides interface for terminal emulators such as
screen and xterm to record user sessions to utmp and wtmp files.

The utempter is a privileged helper used by libutempter library to manipulate
utmp and wtmp files.

This implementation is based on ideas of RedHat's utempter by Erik Troan
(version 0.5.2 at the moment of writing).

There are two interfaces supported: old and new.
New API is recommended for new applications, old - for compatibility with
old software.
