The HAMMER file system time slider utility is a tool for DragonFly's
HAMMER Filesystem (version 1).  The utility is a curses-enabled,
 user-friendly cross between "hammer history" and "undo".

Time Slider enables the user to browse through all available versions of
the given file stored in HAMMER history, view differences btween two
versions, replace the current version with any previous version, restore
a deleted file, and save any previous or deleted version to a new file.
